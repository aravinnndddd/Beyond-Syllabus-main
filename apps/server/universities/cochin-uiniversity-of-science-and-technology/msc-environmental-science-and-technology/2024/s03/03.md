# 24-360-0303: CHEMISTRY OF WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT


## Course Objectives
* Identification and assessment of water quality, interpretation of data, optimization of treatment procedures, reactor operation and modelling procedures, testing and evaluation of materials used in water process technology. Incite interest among the students for capacity building for novelty and innovations in the existing treatment systems they are exposed in their future professional field based on a strong foundation of environmental, analytical and applied chemistry for meeting the need of the public, industry and government statutory organizations. 
* Students are trained and made competent to identify problems from industry and outside, originate project proposals with specific objectives, design of research study/consultancy, generation of pertinent results by standard analytical methods, interpretation of results, evaluation of the problem findings with statutory guidelines, creative ideas, start-ups in water segments, product development and entrepreneurship.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Understand basics of water and wastewater chemistry, role of a hydroanalytical chemist, testing and analysis protocols and classification methods.
* **CO 2:** Water quality data analysis and interpretations for fixing the quality issues of the water treatment process industry with respect to source, process and product water.
* **CO 3:** Decision of the required treatment for solving the problem based the evaluation of the quality parameters and profile based on hydro geochemical perspective using the engineering principles.
* **CO 4:** Testing and evaluation of water based on hydro analytical data and materials for tertiary treatment using principles of adsorption engineering and isotherm models.
* **CO 5:** Additional higher level of deliberation of the technicality of hydro analytical issues of water processing industries through practices to come out with creating suggestions can be reported as publications in standard journals and documents to statutory organizations, industry, courts and governments.
