## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Modern Processors
- Stored-program computer architecture  
- General-purpose cache-based microprocessor architecture  
- Performance metrics, benchmarks, Moore’s Law, pipelining, superscalarity, SIMD  
- Memory hierarchies – cache mapping, prefetch, multicore & multithreaded processors  
- Vector processors – design principles, maximum performance estimates, programming for vector architectures  

### Module 2: Parallel Computers & Networks
- Taxonomy of parallel computing paradigms  
- Shared-memory computers – cache coherence, UMA, ccNUMA

- Networks – basic performance characteristics, buses, switched & fat-tree, mesh, hybrids  

### Module 3: Shared-Memory Programming with OpenMP
- Short introduction to OpenMP – parallel execution, data scoping  
- Work-sharing for loops, synchronization, reductions, loop scheduling, tasking  
- Case study – OpenMP-parallel Jacobi algorithm  

### Module 4: Distributed-Memory Programming with MPI
- Message passing – short introduction to MPI
