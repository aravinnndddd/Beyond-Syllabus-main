# PEADT525: Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing  

## Course Objectives

1. To provide foundational concepts of digital image representation, processing, and analysis—including image digitization, color theory, and data structures—to effectively manipulate and analyze digital images.  
2. To develop the ability to implement advanced image-processing techniques such as image segmentation, edge detection, and image compression, while critically evaluating their performance and quality in practical applications.
