## SEMESTER S1
# LINEAR ALGEBRA AND CALCULUS
**Course Code:** MAT101  

## Course Objectives
1. To equip students with the fundamental concepts of linear algebra and multivariable calculus.  
2. To enable students to solve systems of equations and perform matrix operations including diagonalization and classification of quadratic forms.  
3. To develop the ability to analyze and interpret multivariable functions using derivatives, integrals, and series.  
4. To build a strong foundation in convergence of infinite series and applications of Taylor and Fourier series in engineering problems.
