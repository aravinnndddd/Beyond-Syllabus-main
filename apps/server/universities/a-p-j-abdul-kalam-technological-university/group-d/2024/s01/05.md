## SEMESTER S1
# BASIC CONCEPTS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING
**Course Code:** GDBIO101  

## Course Objectives
1. Prepare students to understand the concepts of growth patterns, enzyme catalysis, and biotransformation.  
2. Develop a systematic approach in students toward solving problems involved in fermentation based on the end product formation.  

## SYLLABUS  

### Module 1 (Biological Concepts, Biomolecules & Cell Growth)  
* Exploring biological concepts – Different types of cells: Animal, Plant, and Bacterial cells.  
* Structure of cells.  
* Cycles of life – Mitosis and Meiosis.  
* Structure and function of biomolecules:  
  - Carbohydrates (mono-, di-, and polysaccharides).  
  - Lipids.  
  - Proteins (amino acids, peptides).  
  - Nucleic acids (DNA & RNA).  
* Cell growth and product synthesis:  
  - Nutritional requirements.  
  - Growth patterns and kinetics in batch culture.  
  - Conditions/factors affecting cell growth and product synthesis.  

### Module 2 (Enzymes and Bioenergetics)  
* Enzymes: Classification and catalysis.  
* Steady-state kinetics.  
* Enzyme inhibition.  
* Regulatory enzymes.  
* Co-enzymes and vitamins.  
* Applications of enzymes in industrial, pharmaceutical, and analytical sectors.  
* Enzyme immobilization.  

### Module 3 (Bioprocess Concepts & Modes of Operation)  
* Basic concepts of upstream and downstream processes.  
* Intracellular and extracellular products.  
* Growth-associated and non-growth-associated products.  
* Modes of bioreactor operation:  
  - Batch bioreactor and its disadvantages.  
  - Continuous bioreactor and its advantages.  
  - Fed-batch bioreactor.  
* Applications of different bioreactor operations.  

### Module 4 (Bioreactors, Aeration, and Instrumentation)  
* Bioreactors – Basic functions of a bioreactor.  
* Parts of a fermenter and their functions.  
* Role of aeration and mixing in oxygen transfer.  
* Mechanism of mixing.  
* Impellers – Types and flow patterns.  
* Introduction to process instrumentation and control:  
  - Common methodologies of measurements.
