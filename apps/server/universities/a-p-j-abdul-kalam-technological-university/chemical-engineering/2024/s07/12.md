## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Characteristics & Membrane Processes)
* Classification of separation processes.  
* Factors influencing the choice of separation process and equipment.  
* Membrane processes: introduction, type, and choice of membranes.  
* Membrane reactors: plate and frame, tubular, spiral wound, hollow fibre – merits.  
* Membrane filtration: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, dialysis.  
* Models for membrane separations.

### Module - 2 (Surfactant-Based Separation Techniques)
* Basic principles and classifications of surfactant-based separations.  
* Surfactants at interfaces and in bulk.  
* Foam fractionation and foam flotation.  
* Adsorptive bubble separations, ion flotation.  
* Microemulsions, macroemulsions, hydrotopes, solvent ablation.  
---
### Module - 3 (Adsorption & Ion Exchange Systems)
* Adsorption systems: interacting solutes, adiabatic adsorbers, velocity effects.  
* Adsorption–desorption operations: thermal desorption, activated carbon solute recovery, pressure/vacuum swing adsorption, regeneration with purge/desorbent.  
* Ion exchange basics, ion exchange resins, binary ion exchange equilibrium, ion movement theory.  
* Applications of ion exchange: ion exclusion, mass transfer in ion exchange systems.  
---
### Module - 4 (Chromatographic Separations)
* Introduction to chromatography, types of chromatography.  
* Elution chromatography: principles and retention theory, band broadening and separation efficiency.  
* Large-scale elution (cyclic/batch) chromatography.  
* Selective adsorption of biological macromolecules.  
* Simulated counter-current techniques.  
* Comparison with other separation methods.
