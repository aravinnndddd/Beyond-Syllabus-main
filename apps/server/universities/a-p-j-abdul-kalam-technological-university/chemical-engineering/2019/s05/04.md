# CHT307: Instrumentation and Process Control

## Course Objectives
* Categorize industrial measuring instruments and explain instrumentation for temperature, pressure, flow, level, composition, and pH.  
* Apply Laplace transforms to solve linear differential equations and determine transfer functions for first-order systems.  
* Analyse the response of linear open-loop second-order systems and systems in series to various forcing functions.  
* Describe different controllers and analyse servo/regulatory problems of closed-loop systems using transient response.  
* Evaluate the stability of linear systems using analytical and graphical methods and design controllers.  

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Measuring Instruments
* Performance characteristics of measuring instruments: static and dynamic.  
* Instruments for temperature, pressure, flow, and level measurement.  
* Detailed study of:  
  - Mercury-in-glass thermometer, thermocouples, thermistors, resistance thermometer, radiation pyrometer  
  - Bourdon gauge, ionization meter, piezoelectric manometer  
  - Orifice meter, coriolis meter, differential pressure level measurement, high-pressure measurement  
  - Conductivity meters, solid level detectors  

### Module 2 – Laplace Transform and First-Order Systems
* Laplace transforms: definitions, properties, derivatives and integrals, final and initial value theorems.  
* Inverse Laplace by partial fraction.  
* Solution of differential equations using Laplace transform.  
* Linear open-loop systems: mercury thermometer, liquid level process (single tank).  

### Module 3 – System Response and Controllers
* Interacting and non-interacting systems.  
* Manometer response to step and sinusoidal inputs.  
* Control valves: types, working principle, and selection.  
* Controllers: P, PI, PID – principles and transfer functions.  

### Module 4 – Closed-Loop Systems and Stability
* Closed-loop feedback control: servo and regulator problems.  
* Block diagram development and reduction.  
* Transient response of simple control systems – step response and offset.

### Module 5 – Frequency Response and Controller Tuning
* Frequency response introduction – substitution rule.  
* Bode diagrams for first-order and second-order systems.  
* Bode stability criterion – gain margin and phase margin.  
* Controller tuning – Ziegler-Nichols method.  
* Comparison of closed-loop responses for various controller settings.
