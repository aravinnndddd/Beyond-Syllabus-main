# CHT205: Fluid and Particle Mechanics

## Course Objectives
* Apply basic properties and transport laws to fluids under static and dynamic conditions.  
* Use fluid flow principles to apply mass, momentum, and energy equations.  
* Design piping networks using concepts of fluid dynamics.  
* Design fluidized and packed beds considering industrial applications.  
* Select valves, pumps, and flow-measuring devices for process industries using fundamental principles.
