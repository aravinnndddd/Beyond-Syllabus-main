# CHT203: Chemical Process Principles

## Course Objectives
* Distinguish and summarize various unit operations and unit processes.  
* Translate physical quantities and empirical equations from one set of units to another accurately.  
* Estimate chemical composition and other physical quantities such as density, flow rate, pressure, and temperature.  
* Apply ideal and real gas equations of state to establish fundamental properties of fluids.  
* Define terminologies related to humidification and use humidity charts to determine air–water vapour properties.  
* Develop and solve basic material and energy balance equations for unit operations and processes in industries.
