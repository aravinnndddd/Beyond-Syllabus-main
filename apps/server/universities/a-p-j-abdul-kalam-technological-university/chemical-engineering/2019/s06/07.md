# CHT342: Material Science and Engineering

## Course Objectives
* Understand atomic structure, crystal systems, and bonding in solids.  
* Explain physical, mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties of materials.  
* Interpret phase diagrams and stability of materials under various environments.  
* Identify properties and applications of alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites, and nanocomposites.  
* Select appropriate materials for chemical process industries considering corrosion, oxidation, and service conditions.  

## Course Content
