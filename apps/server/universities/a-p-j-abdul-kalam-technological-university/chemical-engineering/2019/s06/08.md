# CHT352: Operations Research

## Course Objectives
* Understand the scope and applications of Operations Research in engineering and management.  
* Formulate and solve Linear Programming Problems (LPP) using graphical, simplex, Big-M, and two-phase methods.  
* Analyze duality concepts and perform post-optimality/sensitivity analysis.  
* Formulate and solve transportation and assignment problems using standard algorithms.  
* Apply network models (CPM, PERT) for project planning, shortest path, maximum flow, and spanning tree problems.
