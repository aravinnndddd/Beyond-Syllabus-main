## Course Content

### Module 1 – Microbiology and Biomolecules
* Cell theory, structure of cells, cell fractionation.  
* Classification and characteristics of protist kingdom.  
* Chemicals of life – repetitive and non-repetitive biopolymers (lipids, sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, proteins).  
* Protein structure, nucleotides, RNA, and DNA.  

### Module 2 – Enzyme Kinetics
* Simple enzyme kinetics with one or two substrates.  
* Michaelis-Menten kinetics – evaluation of parameters.  
* Substrate activation and inhibition, modulation and regulation of enzyme activity.  
* Competitive and uncompetitive inhibition, enzyme specificity and hypotheses.  

### Module 3 – Industrial Enzymes and Metabolic Pathways
* Industrially important enzymes, immobilized enzyme technology, applications in medical and analytical fields.  
* Batch cultivation and growth cycle (lag, exponential, stationary, death phases).  
* Metabolic pathways and energetics: ATP, ADP, NAD, redox coupling.  
* EMP pathway, pentose phosphate cycle, TCA cycle.  
* Transport across cell membranes: passive, active, facilitated diffusion.  

### Module 4 – Transport Phenomena and Bioreactors
* Gas-liquid mass transfer in cellular systems, oxygen transfer rates, metabolic oxygen utilization.  
* Mass transfer across bubbles and free surfaces with/without agitation.  
* Bioreactors: CSTR, bubble column, airlift, fluidized bed, packed bed, photo-bioreactors.  
* Types of reactors for sterilization.  

### Module 5 – Fermentation Technology and Biosensors
* Medium formulation, design, and operation of aseptic aerobic fermentation processes.  
* Configurations of fermentors.  
* Concept of biosensors – physical, chemical, and gas analysis sensors.  
* On-line and off-line sensors for cell properties.
