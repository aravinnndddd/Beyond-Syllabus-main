# CHT322: Energy Engineering

## Course Objectives
* Identify different sources of energy, analyze the global and Indian energy scenario, and understand conventional energy production systems.  
* Explain the concepts and applications of solar and ocean energy conversion.  
* Describe wind and biomass energy conversion technologies.  
* Explain the working principles and types of fuel cells and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) systems.  
* Understand the concepts of energy conservation and audit, and apply these in process plants and daily life.  

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Conventional Energy Systems
* Classification of energy, world and Indian energy resources and consumption.  
* Energy crisis and alternatives.  
* Thermal, hydel, and nuclear power plants – efficiency, merits, and demerits.  
* Fluidized bed combustion and combined cycle power plants.  

### Module 2 – Solar and Ocean Energy
