# CHT304: Transport Phenomena

## Course Objectives
* Explain the mechanisms of momentum, heat, and mass transfer.  
* Predict transport coefficients of gases using basic physical variables.  
* Solve isothermal steady-state momentum transfer problems in simple geometries using shell momentum balance, equations of change, and boundary conditions.  
* Obtain analytical solutions for steady-state heat transfer problems using shell energy balance and equations of change.  
* Analyze steady-state diffusion problems using shell mass balance.  

## Course Content
