# CHT202: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics

## Course Objectives
* Apply the laws of thermodynamics to analyze engineering processes.  
* Define thermodynamic properties and processes of a system.  
* Relate thermodynamic properties to measurable quantities.  
* Calculate property changes for mixtures under specified conditions.  
* Construct phase diagrams and explain VLE for miscible and immiscible liquids.  
* Evaluate equilibrium constants, compositions, and degrees of freedom for reactions under given conditions.  

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Basic Concepts and Laws
* Scope of thermodynamics, systems (closed, open, isolated), properties (intensive, extensive), path and state functions.  
* Reversible and irreversible processes, Zeroth law of thermodynamics.  
* First law – energy balance for closed systems, limitations, second law – Carnot principles, entropy definition and calculation for ideal gases.  
* Third law, energy balance for open systems (flow through pipes, nozzles, compressors).  

### Module 2 – Thermodynamic Properties and Relations
* P-V and P-T diagrams of pure substances, equations of state (van der Waals, Redlich-Kwong, Peng-Robinson, Virial).  
* Principle of corresponding states, compressibility chart.  
* Fundamental property relations, Maxwell’s equations, Clausius-Clapeyron equation.  
* Entropy-heat capacity relationships, Joule-Thomson coefficient, Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.  
* Fugacity and activity of pure fluids, residual properties.  

### Module 3 – Solutions and Partial Molar Properties
* Partial molar properties, chemical potential, fugacity in solution.  
* Ideal solutions – Lewis-Randall rule, Raoult’s law, Henry’s law.  
* Activity, activity coefficient, Gibbs-Duhem equation.  
* Property changes of mixing, excess properties.  
* Criterion of phase equilibrium and stability.  

### Module 4 – Phase Equilibria and VLE
* Phase rule for non-reacting systems, Duhem’s theorem.  
* VLE – binary solutions, ideal and non-ideal solutions, deviations, azeotropes, VLE at low pressures.  
* Activity coefficient models: Wohl, Margules, van Laar, Wilson, NRTL, UNIQUAC, UNIFAC (concepts only).  
* High-pressure VLE equations, vaporization equilibrium constant, bubble point, dew point, flash calculations.  
* Phase diagrams for VLLE in partially miscible and immiscible systems.  

### Module 5 – Chemical Reaction Equilibria
* Extent of reaction, equilibrium constant, standard free energy change, reaction feasibility.  
* Effect of temperature on equilibrium constant, evaluation of equilibrium constant.  
* Equilibrium conversion in gas-phase reactions, effect of pressure and parameters.  
* Simultaneous reactions, phase rule for reacting systems.
