# EST102: Programming in C

## Course Objectives

This course introduces students to fundamental programming concepts using the C language and enhances problem-solving skills through computational thinking.

* Analyze a computational problem and develop an algorithm/flowchart to find its solution.  
* Develop readable C programs with branching and looping statements, which use arithmetic, logical, relational or bitwise operators.  
* Write readable C programs with arrays, structure or union for storing the data to be processed.  
* Divide a given computational problem into a number of modules and develop a readable multi-function C program by using recursion if required.  
* Write readable C programs which use pointers for array processing and parameter passing.  
* Develop readable C programs with files for reading input and storing output.  

## Course Content

### Module - 1

* Basics of Computer Hardware and Software  
* Basics of Computer Architecture: processor, memory, input & output devices  
* Application Software & System Software: compilers, interpreters, high level and low level languages  
* Introduction to structured approach to programming, flow chart, algorithms, pseudo code (bubble sort, linear search â€“ algorithms and pseudocode)  

### Module - 2

* Program Basics  
* Basic structure of C program: character set, tokens, identifiers in C, variables and data types, constants, console IO operations, `printf` and `scanf`  
* Operators and Expressions: expressions and arithmetic operators, relational and logical operators, conditional operator, `sizeof` operator, assignment operators and bitwise operators  
* Operator precedence  
* Control Flow Statements: `if` statement, `switch` statement, unconditional branching using `goto` statement, `while` loop, `do while` loop, `for` loop, `break` and `continue` statements  
* Simple programs covering control flow  

### Module - 3

* Arrays and Strings  
* Arrays declaration and initialization, 1-dimensional array, 2-dimensional array  
* String processing: in-built string handling functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strcmp`, `puts`, `gets`)  
* Linear search program, bubble sort program, simple programs covering arrays and strings  

### Module - 4

* Working with Functions  
* Introduction to modular programming, writing functions, formal parameters, actual parameters  
* Pass by value, recursion, arrays as function parameters  
* Structure, union, storage classes, scope and lifetime of variables  
* Simple programs using functions  

### Module - 5

* Pointers and Files  
* Basics of pointers: declaring pointers, accessing data through pointers, NULL pointer, array access using pointers, pass by reference effect  
* File operations: open, close, read, write, append  
* Sequential access and random access to files  
* In-built file handling functions: `rewind()`, `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `feof()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`  
* Simple programs covering pointers and files
