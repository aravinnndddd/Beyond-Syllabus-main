# MAT102: Vector Calculus, Differential Equations and Transforms

## Course Objectives

This course introduces the fundamental tools of vector calculus, ordinary differential equations, and transforms with emphasis on their applications in engineering.

* Compute the derivatives and line integrals of vector functions and learn their applications.  
* Evaluate surface and volume integrals and learn their inter-relations and applications.  
* Solve homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear differential equations with constant coefficients.  
* Compute Laplace transforms and apply them to solve ODEs arising in engineering.  
* Determine the Fourier transforms of functions and apply them to solve problems arising in engineering.
