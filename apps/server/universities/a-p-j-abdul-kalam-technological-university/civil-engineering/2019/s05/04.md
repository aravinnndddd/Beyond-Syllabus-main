# CET307: Hydrology & Water Resources Engineering

## Course Objectives

- Describe and estimate the different components of the hydrologic cycle by processing hydrometeorological data  
- Determine the crop water requirements for the design of irrigation canals by recollecting the principles of irrigation engineering  
- Perform the estimation of streamflow and/or describe the river behavior and control structures  
- Describe and apply the principles of reservoir engineering to estimate the capacity of reservoirs and their useful life  
- Demonstrate the principles of groundwater engineering and apply them for computing the yield of aquifers and wells  

## Course Content

### Module I

- Hydrologic cycle  
- Precipitation: mechanism, types, forms and measurement using rain gauges
