# CET203: Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics

## Course Objectives

* Recall the relevant principles of hydrostatics and hydraulics of pipes and open channels. (Cognitive Level: Remembering)  
* Identify or describe the type, characteristics or properties of fluid flow. (Cognitive Level: Understanding)  
* Estimate the fluid pressure, perform the stability check of bodies under hydrostatic condition. (Cognitive Level: Applying)  
* Compute discharge through pipes or estimate the forces on pipe bends by applying hydraulic principles of continuity, energy and/or momentum. (Cognitive Level: Applying)  
* Analyze or compute the flow through open channels, perform the design of prismatic channels. (Cognitive Level: Analyzing)
