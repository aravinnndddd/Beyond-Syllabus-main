# CET425: Applied Earth Systems

## Course Objectives

- Explain the concept of Earth as a system of interrelated components and associated exogenic/endogenic processes  
- Appraise geological agents and their respective erosion, transportation and deposition regimes and landforms formed  
- Contemplate constraints and processes that continuously affect Earth’s surface and its stability  
- Evaluate the significance of Plate Tectonics theory to explain geodynamic features and processes of Earth’s surface  
- Understand oceanographic and atmospheric regimes and their influence on Earth subsystems  
- Understand implications of human interaction with the Earth system
