# CET413: Prestressed Concrete

## Course Objectives

- Explain the concepts of prestressing and analyze prestressed concrete members for stresses and losses.  
- Analyze for flexure, shear, and torsional resistance of PSC members.  
- Design pre-tensioned and post-tensioned members symmetrical about the vertical axis.  
- Analyse the deflections of prestressed concrete members.  
- Analyze the transfer of prestress in pretensioned members and anchorage zone stresses in post-tensioned members.  
- Analyze prestressing of statically indeterminate structures and design continuous members.  
- Analyze composite construction of prestressed and in situ concrete.  
- Analyze and design PSC slabs.
