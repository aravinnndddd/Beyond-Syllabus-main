# CET306: Design of Hydraulic Structures

## Course Objectives

- Elucidate the causes of failure and principles of design of various components of hydraulic structures  
- Describe canal structure features and design alluvial canals  
- Perform hydraulic design of minor irrigation structures such as cross drainage works, canal falls, and cross regulators  
- Prepare scaled drawings of various minor irrigation structures  
- Explain dam design principles and perform stability analysis of gravity dams
