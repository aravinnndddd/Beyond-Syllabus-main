# CET436: Transportation Planning

## Course Objectives

- Identify the need for transportation planning, the issues and challenges related to transportation and its interaction with urban structure and land use.  
- Apply the concept of travel demand and analyse its role in transportation planning and apply the concept in systems approach to transportation planning process.  
- Apply the concept of delineation of study area, sampling of data, and data collection techniques for the four-stage planning process and analyse the techniques for predicting trip generation.  
- Apply and analyse the methods for predicting trip distribution, mode split and traffic assignment.  
- Apply the land use transport models and analyse the sustainable approaches to transportation planning and preparation of comprehensive mobility plan with application of GIS.
