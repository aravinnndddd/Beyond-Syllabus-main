# Building Information Modelling

## Course Objectives

- Explain the concept and advantages of BIM  
- Apply the various processes on a BIM model  
- Appraise the collaborative and interoperability capabilities of BIM  
- Explain BIM execution plan  
- Explain the principles of integrated project delivery  

## Course Content

### Module 1

**Introduction to BIM**  
- Traditional AEC Business Model and its inefficiencies  
- What is BIM? – BIM vs 3D vs 2D – BIM as a product vs BIM as a process  
- BIM as a lifecycle platform  
- Why BIM – incentives and benefits – technical and financial  
- The Evolution to Object-Based Parametric Modeling  
- BIM Model Quality and Model Checking  

### Module 2

**BIM Software Training**  
- Create Modeling Views  
- Model Layout  
- Architectural Modeling  
- Structural Modeling  
- MEP Modeling  
- Construction Modeling  
- Project Management  
- Revit Families  
- Tools and Techniques  
- Project Phasing  
- Document and Present the Design  
- Analyze the Design (Energy, solar, area, etc.)  
- Schedules  
- Rendering  
- Walkthroughs  

*(Topics have to be discussed and demonstrated with the help of software at the Laboratory; each topic will be an assignment in each week. Theory classes may progress with the other modules.)*
