# CST424: Programming Paradigms

## Course Objectives
* Explain the criteria for evaluating programming languages and compare imperative, functional, and logic programming languages.  
* Illustrate the characteristics of data types and variables.  
* Comprehend how control flow structures and subprograms help in developing the structure of a program to solve computational problems.  
* Explain the characteristics of object-oriented programming languages.  
* Compare concurrency constructs in different programming languages.
