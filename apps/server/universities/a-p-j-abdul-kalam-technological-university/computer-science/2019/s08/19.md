# CST458: Software Testing  

## Course Objectives  
* Understand different software testing techniques and apply unit testing using JUnit.  
* Use mutation testing to detect hidden defects in code.  
* Explain graph coverage criteria for control flow and data flow graphs.  
* Demonstrate black-box testing approaches for domain and functional testing.  
* Apply PEX tool for symbolic execution-based testing.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction to Software Testing  
* Popular Software Errors – Ariane 5, Therac 25, Intel Pentium Bug.  
* What is Software Testing? Why testing is necessary? Software Quality and Role of Testing.  
* Testing Process – Levels 0 to 4 thinking.  
* Software Testing Terminologies – Verification, Validation, Testing, Faults, Errors, Bugs, Test Cases, Coverage Criteria.  
* Types of Testing – Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, Beta, Functional, Stress, Performance, Usability, Regression.  
* Testing Methods – Black Box, White Box, Grey Box.  

### Module 2 – Unit Testing  
* Concept of Unit Testing – Static and Dynamic.  
* Dynamic Unit Testing – Control Flow, Data Flow, Domain, Functional Testing.  
* Mutation Testing – Mutants, Mutation Operators, Mutation Score.  
* JUnit Framework for Unit Testing.  
* Case Study – Mutation Testing using JUnit and MuClipse.  

### Module 3 – Unit Testing: White Box Approaches  
* Graph Coverage Criteria – Node, Edge, Edge Pair, Path, Prime Path, Round Trip Coverage.  
* Data Flow Criteria – du paths, du pairs.  
* Subsumption Relationships among Graph Coverage Criteria.  
* Graph Coverage for Source Code – Control Flow Graphs (if, switch, loops, exceptions).  
* Graph Coverage for Design Elements – Call Graphs, Class Inheritance Testing, Data Flow at Design Level, Inter-Procedural du pairs.  
* Case Study – Graph-based Testing using JUnit.  

### Module 4 – Unit Testing: Black Box Approaches
