## Course Objectives
* Summarize aspects of distributed computation models and logical time.
* Illustrate election algorithms, global snapshot algorithms, and termination detection algorithms.
* Compare token-based, non-token-based, and quorum-based mutual exclusion algorithms.
* Recognize the significance of deadlock detection and shared memory in distributed systems.
* Explain failure recovery and consensus concepts.
* Illustrate distributed file system architectures.
