# CST301: Formal Languages and Automata Theory

## Course Objectives
* Classify a given formal language into Regular, Context-Free, Context-Sensitive, Recursive or Recursively Enumerable. *(Cognitive knowledge level: Understand)*
* Explain a formal representation of a given regular language as a finite state automaton, regular grammar, regular expression and Myhill-Nerode relation. *(Cognitive knowledge level: Understand)*
* Design a Pushdown Automaton and a Context-Free Grammar for a given context-free language. *(Cognitive knowledge level: Apply)*
* Design Turing machines as language acceptors or transducers. *(Cognitive knowledge level: Apply)*
* Explain the notion of decidability. *(Cognitive knowledge level: Understand)*
