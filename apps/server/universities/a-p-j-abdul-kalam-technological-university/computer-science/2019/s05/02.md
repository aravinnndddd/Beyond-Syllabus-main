# CST303: Computer Networks

## Course Objectives
* Explain the features of computer networks, protocols, and network design models.
* Describe the fundamental characteristics of the physical layer and identify the usage in network communication.
* Explain the design issues of data link layer, link layer protocols, bridges and switches.
* Illustrate wired LAN protocols (IEEE 802.3) and wireless LAN protocols (IEEE 802.11).
* Select appropriate routing algorithms, congestion control techniques, and Quality of Service requirements for a network.
* Illustrate the functions and protocols of the network layer, transport layer, and application layer in inter-networking.
