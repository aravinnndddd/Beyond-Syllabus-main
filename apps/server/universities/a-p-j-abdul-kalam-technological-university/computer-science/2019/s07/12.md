# CST455: Object Oriented Concepts

## Course Objectives

* Develop Java programs using the object-oriented concepts - classes, objects, constructors, data hiding, inheritance and polymorphism. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Utilise data types, operators, control statements, built-in packages & interfaces, Input/Output Streams and Files in Java to develop programs. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Illustrate how robust programs can be written in Java using exception handling mechanism. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Develop application programs in Java using multithreading. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Develop GUI-based application programs using event handling features and Swing in Java. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
