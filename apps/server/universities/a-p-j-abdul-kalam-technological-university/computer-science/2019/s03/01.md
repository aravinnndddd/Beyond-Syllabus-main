# CST201: Data Structures

## Course Objectives

* Design an algorithm for a computational task and calculate the time/space complexities of that algorithm (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Identify the suitable data structure (array or linked list) to represent a data item required to be processed to solve a given computational problem and write an algorithm to find the solution of the computational problem (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Write an algorithm to find the solution of a computational problem by selecting an appropriate data structure (binary tree/graph) to represent a data item to be processed (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Store a given dataset using an appropriate Hash Function to enable efficient access of data in the given set (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Select appropriate sorting algorithms to be used in specific circumstances (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyze)  
* Design and implement Data Structures for solving real world problems efficiently (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
