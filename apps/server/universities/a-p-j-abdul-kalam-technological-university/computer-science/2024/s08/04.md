# PECST864: Computational Complexity

## Course Objectives

1. To develop an understanding of various computational models, including deterministic and nondeterministic models, Turing machines, and other computational models, and analyze their capabilities and limitations, focusing on how these models influence the classification of problems into complexity classes.  
2. To explore key complexity classes such as P, NP, and PSPACE, and apply polynomial-time reductions to prove the NP-completeness of various problems, and also investigate space complexity, polynomial hierarchy, and advanced topics.
