# PECST752 - Responsible Artificial Intelligence

## Course Objectives

1. To impart the ideas of fairness, accountability, bias, and privacy as fundamental aspects of responsible AI.  
2. To teach the principles of interpretability techniques including simplification, visualization, intrinsic interpretable methods, and post hoc interpretability for AI models.  
3. To give the learner understanding of the ethical principles guiding AI development, along with privacy concerns and security challenges associated with AI deployment.
