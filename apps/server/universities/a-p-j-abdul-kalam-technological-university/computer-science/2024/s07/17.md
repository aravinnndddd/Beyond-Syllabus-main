# PECST75 - Programming Languages

## Course Objectives

1. To enable the students to understand various constructs and their comparisons in different high-level languages so that they can choose a suitable programming language for solving particular problems.  
2. To develop the student’s ability to understand the salient features and paradigms in the landscape of programming languages.
