# PECST795 - Topics in Theoretical Computer Science

## Course Objectives

1. To understand and apply spectral graph theory techniques to analyze and solve complex graph problems, such as community detection and network design, through detailed study and hands-on assignments.  
2. To develop and evaluate LP- and SDP-based approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, including real-world applications like scheduling and optimization, by implementing these algorithms and assessing their performance in practical scenarios.
