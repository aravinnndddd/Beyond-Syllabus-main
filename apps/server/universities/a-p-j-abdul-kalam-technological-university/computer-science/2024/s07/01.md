# PECST741 - Formal Methods in Software Engineering

## Course Objectives

1. To enable the learners to apply formal methods for modelling, validation, and verification of software systems.  
2. To familiarize with a series of advanced tools that address challenges faced in design, coding, and verification.  
3. To provide an introduction to the theoretical aspects of these tools, as well as hands-on exploration.
