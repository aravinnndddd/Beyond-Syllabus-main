# UCEST105: Algorithmic Thinking with Python

## Course Objectives

- Develop algorithmic thinking for solving real-world problems.
- Explore problem-solving paradigms like brute force, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and heuristics.
- Learn Python programming fundamentals and apply them to computational models.

---

## Course Contents

### Module 1: Problem Solving & Python Essentials

- Problem-solving strategies: trial and error, heuristics, means-ends analysis, backtracking.
- Problem-solving process: modeling, algorithm development, testing, evaluation.
- Python basics: variables, data types, math module, I/O operations, operators.

### Module 2: Pseudocode & Flowcharts

- Pseudocode constructs: sequencing, selection (if-else, case), repetition (for, while, repeat-until).
- Sample problems: expressions, conditionals, loops, factorial, grading, etc.
- Flowchart symbols and visualization using tools like RAPTOR.

### Module 3: Python Programming & Recursion

- Control structures: if-else, elif, loops.
- Data types: list, tuple, set, string, dictionary.
- Arrays using NumPy.
- Functions and modularization.
- Recursion: call stack, sample problems (Fibonacci, GCD, factorial, digit sum).

### Module 4: Algorithmic Paradigms

- Brute-force: password guessing.
- Divide-and-conquer: merge sort.
- Dynamic programming: Fibonacci comparison.
- Greedy algorithms: task scheduling.
- Randomized algorithms: coupon collection, hat-check problem.
