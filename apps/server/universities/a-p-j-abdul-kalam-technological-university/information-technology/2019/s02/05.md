## Course Content

### Module 1: Basics of Computer Hardware and Software

- Basics of computer architecture – processor, memory, input and output devices  
- Application software and system software – compilers, interpreters, high-level and low-level languages  
- Introduction to structured programming  
- Flowcharts, algorithms, and pseudocode – examples with bubble sort and linear search  

---

### Module 2: Program Basics

- Basic structure of a C program  
- Character set, tokens, identifiers, variables, data types, and constants  
- Console I/O operations – `printf()` and `scanf()`  
- Operators and expressions – arithmetic, relational, logical, conditional, bitwise, `sizeof`, and assignment operators  
- Operator precedence and associativity  
- Control flow statements – `if`, `switch`, `goto`, loops (`while`, `do-while`, `for`), `break`, and `continue`  
- Simple programs covering control structures  

---

### Module 3: Arrays and Strings

- Declaration and initialization of arrays – 1D and 2D arrays  
- String processing – built-in functions: `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcat()`, `strcmp()`, `puts()`, `gets()`  
- Programs for linear search and bubble sort  
- Simple programs using arrays and strings  

---

### Module 4: Working with Functions

- Introduction to modular programming  
- Function definition, formal and actual parameters  
- Pass-by-value, recursion, arrays as function parameters  
- Structures and unions  
- Storage classes; scope and lifetime of variables  
- Simple programs using functions and structures  

---

### Module 5: Pointers and Files

- Basics of pointers – declaration, dereferencing, `NULL` pointer  
- Array access using pointers  
- Effect of pass-by-reference using pointers  
- File operations – open, close, read, write, append  
- Sequential and random file access – built-in functions: `rewind()`, `fseek()`, `ftell()`, `feof()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`  
- Simple programs using pointers and file handling
