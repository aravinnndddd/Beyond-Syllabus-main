# ITT205: Problem Solving Using Python

## Course Objectives
- To understand the basics of Python programming.
- To develop problem-solving skills using programming techniques.
- To apply Python programming constructs in practical scenarios.
- To implement modular and object-oriented design using Python.
- To work with data structures and file handling in Python.

## Course Outcomes
- Explain the core concepts and flow control of Python programming.
- Use Python data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Write modular programs using functions, recursion, and lambda expressions.
- Handle files and exceptions in Python.
- Implement object-oriented programming features like classes, objects, and inheritance.

## Syllabus

### Module 1
**Introduction To Python**: Understanding Python-identifiers, variables, keywords, expressions and statements, evaluation of expressions, Operators and operands, operator precedence, indentation.  
**Python Program Flow Control**: Decision making - if, if..else, elif. Loops - for, while, for...else, while...else, Control statements using pass, continue, break.

### Module 2
**Strings and Lists**: String traversal, string slices and comparison with examples, The string module, character classification.  
**Lists**: List values, accessing elements, list membership, Lists and for loops, List operations, List slices, List deletion, Matrices.  
**Tuples**: Mutability and tuples, tuple assignment, Tuples as return values, Tuple operations.  
**Dictionaries**: Operations and methods.

### Module 3
**Python Functions, Modules and Packages**: Function definition, calling functions, parameters and arguments, the return statement, type conversion and coercion, composition of functions, Lambda function, mathematical functions, user-defined functions, Recursion.  
**Modules**: Built-in modules, creating modules, import statement.  
**Packages in Python**: Importing modules from a package.

### Module 4
**Python Files and Exceptions**: Python file handling, open, write, read text files, writing variables, Directories in Python, Pickling, Exception Handling.

### Module 5
**Python Object Oriented Programming**: Introduction to classes and objects - class definition, attributes, instances, sameness, instances as arguments and return values. Constructor, class attributes and destructors, Inheritance.
