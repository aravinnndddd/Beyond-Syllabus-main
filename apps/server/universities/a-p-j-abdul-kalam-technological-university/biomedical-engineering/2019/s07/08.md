# Artificial Organs and Implants

## course objectives
- To understand artificial organ design.  
- To explore 3D printing applications in biomedical engineering.

## course outcomes
- **CO1**: Explain the design principles and materials used in artificial organ replacements.  
- **CO2**: Describe the working of artificial organ systems including kidney, skin and liver.  
- **CO3**: Apply concepts of biomaterials, drug delivery, and gene therapy in tissue engineering.  
- **CO4**: Analyze 3D printing processes and applications in prosthetics and maxillofacial reconstruction.

## syllabus

### Module 1: Organ Replacement (9 hours)
- Hip joint replacement: design, materials, fixation methods, wear and biocompatibility.  
- Artificial heart valves: mechanical vs bioprosthetic valves, design parameters, flow dynamics.  
- Lung replacement: artificial lung devices, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

### Module 2: Organ Systems (9 hours)
- Artificial kidney: dialysis principles, hemodialysis vs peritoneal dialysis, dialyzer design.  
- Skin replacement: skin grafting, synthetic skin substitutes, wound healing materials.  
- Liver replacement: bioartificial liver devices, detoxification methods.  
- Sterilization techniques for implants: autoclaving, gamma irradiation, ethylene oxide.

### Module 3: Tissue Engineering (9 hours)
- Biomaterial engineering: polymers, ceramics, composites for implants and scaffolds.  
- Drug delivery systems: controlled release devices, biodegradable implants.
