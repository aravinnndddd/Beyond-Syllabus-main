## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Flow Instabilities

-   Definition, classification (**Temporal vs. Spatial**), and applications of flow instabilities.
-   Mathematical tools like **Linear Stability Theory** and the Perturbation Method.
-   **Boundary Layer Instabilities** (Tollmien-Schlichting waves) and the mechanism of boundary layer transition.

### Module 2: Shock Induced Flow Instabilities

-   Formation and properties of **shock waves** and **shock-boundary layer interactions**.
-   Analysis of **shock oscillations** and shock-turbulence interactions.
-   Mitigation strategies and design considerations for supersonic aircraft.

### Module 3: Combustion Induced Flow Instabilities

-   Introduction to **thermo-acoustic instabilities**.
-   **Flame dynamics** and their interactions with the surrounding flow.
-   Experimental and computational techniques for analyzing and mitigating combustion instabilities.

### Module 4: Emerging Instability Phenomena

-   Introduction to **non-linear stability** and **multi-phase flow instabilities**.
-   **Advanced computational (CFD)** and **experimental (PIV, LDA)** methods.
-   The impact of new technologies and the integration of **AI & ML in flow prediction**.
