# OEAOT832 - Principles of Vibration

## Course Objectives

-   To examine the **dynamic behaviour** of various structural elements and learn about **vibration control techniques**.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Vibrations

-   **Lagrange’s Equation of Motion**, Simple Harmonic Motion, and **D’ Alembert’s Principle**.
-   **Free and forced vibrations** of **Single Degree of Freedom** systems.
-   Analysis of simple and compound pendulums and support excitation.

### Module 2: Modes of Vibration

-   **Principle modes** and **principle coordinates**.
-   Equations of motion for **two and multi-degree-of-freedom systems**.
-   **Orthogonality condition** and solving **eigenvalue problems**.

### Module 3: Approximate Methods

-   **Approximate methods** for finding natural frequencies, including **Rayleigh’s, Stodola, Matrix Iteration, Holzer**, and **Dunkerley’s methods**.
-   Analysis of longitudinal, lateral, and torsional vibrations.

### Module 4: Vibration Control

-   **Dynamic vibration absorbers** and neutralizers.
-   Design and application of **vibration isolators**.
-   Introduction to **Active Vibration Control** using piezoelectric sensors and actuators.
