## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Acoustics

-   **Basic acoustic terminology**, plane waves, and the velocity of sound in fluids.
-   **Acoustic energy density**, intensity, and impedance.
-   Logarithmic **decibel scales** and noise regulations.

### Module 2: Sound Generation from Fluid Flow

-   Conservation laws and governing equations of fluid mechanics.
-   **Lighthill’s analogy** and the derivation of Lighthill’s equation.
-   **Sound radiation** from simple sources like monopoles, dipoles, and quadrupoles.

### Module 3: Duct Acoustics and Aircraft Noise Sources

-   **Duct acoustics**, sound fields in ducts, and cavity noise.
-   **Turbo-machinery noise** and buzz-saw noise.
-   Noise suppression devices and identification of major aircraft noise sources (engine, propellers, fans).

### Module 4: Boundary Layer Noise and Human Factors

-   Noise produced by **boundary layers** on external surfaces and from **sonic booms**.
-   **Impact of noise on humans** (Phone and Sone scales) and aircraft noise regulations.
-   **Noise control** by source modification, transmission path alterations, and receiver protection.
