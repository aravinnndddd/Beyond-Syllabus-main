# PCAOT402 - Flight Mechanics

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the **performance of airplanes** under different operating conditions.
2.  To examine the aircraft’s **static and dynamic response** to changes in flying circumstances.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Steady Level Performance

-   CSteady level performance: True, indicated and equivalent airspeed. Mach
number, Drag polar equation and curves. Straight and level flight, thrust
required and available. Power required and available, Effect of altitude on
thrust and power. Conditions for minimum drag and minimum power
required. 


### Module 2: Accelerated Performance

-   Calculation of aircraft **range and endurance**.
-   Analysis of **gliding, climbing, take-off, and landing performance**.
-   Study of **turning performance** and the **V-n diagram**.

### Module 3: Static Stability

-  Degree of freedom, Static and dynamic stability, static longitudinal stability conditions. Static longitudinal stability - Stick fixed
and Stick free (Contribution of individual components, neutral point, static
margin, Hinge moment, Elevator control effectiveness). Directional
Stability- Weather cock stability, dorsal fin, directional control. Lateral
Stability- Dihedral effect ,side slip 


### Module 4: Aircraft Dynamics

-   Derivation of aircraft **equations of motion** and stability analysis using Routh’s criterion.
-   **Longitudinal dynamics**, including **Phugoid motion** (long and short period).
-   **Lateral dynamics**, including **Spiral divergence**, **Dutch roll**, and **spin**.
