# PEAOT413 - Industrial Aerodynamics

## Course Objectives

1.  To familiarize students with **non-aeronautical uses of aerodynamics** in road vehicles, buildings, and problems of flow-induced vibrations.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Atmosphere and Wind Tunnels

-   The role of the atmosphere in aerodynamics, including the **atmospheric boundary layer**.
-   Types of wind and the effects of terrain.
-   Classification of **Wind Tunnels** and the concept of **Dimensional Analysis** for flow similarity.

### Module 2: Wind Engineering

-   Principles of **wind energy collectors**, including vertical and horizontal axis wind turbines.
-   Analysis of **Power coefficient** and **Betz coefficient** using momentum theory.
-   Introduction to the **aerodynamic design of blades**.

### Module 3: Vehicle and Building Aerodynamics

-   **Aerodynamics of automobiles**, trains, and hovercraft, focusing on power requirements and drag.
-   **Wind forces on buildings**, including pressure distribution on low-rise buildings and special problems of tall buildings and bridges.

### Module 4: Flow Induced Vibrations & Sports Aerodynamics

-   Introduction to **atmospheric turbulence**, boundary layers, and flow separation.
-   **Flow-induced vibrations** such as vortex shedding, galloping, and stall flutter.
-   Basics of **sports aerodynamics** in applications like cycling, football, and projectile sports.
