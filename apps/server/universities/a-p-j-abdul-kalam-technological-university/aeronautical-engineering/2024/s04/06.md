# PEAOT412 - Viscous Flow Theory

## Course Objectives

1.  To provide a comprehensive understanding of **viscous flow phenomena** and their impact on aircraft design, performance, and operation, and to equip students with the skills to analyze, model, and optimize these effects.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Viscous Flow

-   Introduction to viscosity and the differences between **Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids**.
-   Derivation and physical interpretation of the governing equations: **Continuity** and **Navier-Stokes**.
-   Exact solutions for simple cases like **Couette flow** and **Poiseuille flow**.

### Module 2: Laminar Flow

-   Analysis of fully developed **laminar flow in pipes and channels** (Hagen-Poiseuille law).
-   Introduction to **Boundary Layer Theory**, including the derivation of boundary layer equations and the **Blasius solution** for a flat plate.
-   Study of **heat transfer** in laminar flows.

### Module 3: Turbulent Flow

-   Characteristics of **turbulent flow**, including **Reynolds decomposition** and averaging.
-   Analysis of **turbulent boundary layers** and flow in pipes using the **Moody chart**.
-   Understanding **mixing and heat transfer** in turbulent flows.

### Module 4: Advanced Topics in Viscous Flow

-   Introduction to **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** for viscous flow analysis.
-   Study of **high Reynolds number flows** in aerodynamics.
-   Introduction to **flow-induced vibrations** and **aeroelasticity**.
