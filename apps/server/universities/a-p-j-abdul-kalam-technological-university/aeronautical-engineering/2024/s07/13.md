## Course Objectives

1.  To introduce students to **particle motion and rocket motion** in space.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Solar System and Orbital Mechanics

-   **Reference frames and coordinate systems** used in space mechanics.
-   **Kepler's laws**, estimation of orbital and escape velocity.
-   The **two-body problem**, satellite orbits, and **Lagrange coefficients and points**.

### Module 2: Orbit Determination and Maneuvers

-   Determining orbital position as a function of time using **Gibbs method** and **Gauss’s method**.
-   **Orbital maneuvers**, including **Hohmann Transfer**, chase, and phasing maneuvers.

### Module 3: Principles of Rocket Motion

-   Derivation of the **thrust equation** and analysis of one and two-dimensional rocket motion.
-   Description of **vertical, inclined, and gravity turn trajectories**.
-   The need for **multi-staging** and vehicle optimization.

### Module 4: Rocket Vehicle Dynamics

-   **Stage separation dynamics** and separation techniques.
-   **Aerodynamic jet control** methods for rocket vehicles.
-   **Drag estimation**, including wave, skin friction, form, and base pressure drag.
