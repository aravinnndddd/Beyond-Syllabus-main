# PEAOT753 - Rotary Wing Theory and Helicopter Aerodynamics

## Course Objectives

1.  To provide an introduction to the basic ideas of the **evolution, performance, and associated stability problems** of helicopters.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction and Vertical Flight

-   **Evolution of the helicopter** and its various configurations.
-   Rotor analysis in vertical flight using **Momentum theory** for hover, climb, descent, and autorotation.
-   Introduction to **Blade Element Theory** for thrust and power approximations.

### Module 2: Forward Flight Aerodynamics

-   Rotor mechanisms for **forward flight**, including flapping motion and rotor control.
-   Aerodynamic analysis in forward flight using both **momentum theory and blade element theory** to determine thrust, torque, and power.

### Module 3: Aerodynamic Design and Performance

-   **Aerodynamic design** considerations, including blade section design and blade tip shapes.
-   **Performance analysis** in various flight regimes: hover, vertical flight, forward level flight, and climb.
-   Understanding the **rotor limits envelope** and high-altitude operation.

### Module 4: Trim, Stability, and Control

-   Concepts of **trim, static stability, and dynamic stability**.
-   Analysis of stability against various disturbances (incidence, forward speed, angular velocity, etc.).
-   Introduction to **hingeless rotors**, control systems, and **auto-stabilization**.
