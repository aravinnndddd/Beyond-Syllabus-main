## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction and Augmentation Systems

-   Introduction to **guidance and control**, including coordinate frames and equations of motion.
-   Need for automatic flight control systems.
-   **Stability Augmentation Systems (SAS)** and **Control Augmentation Systems (CAS)**, including limited and full authority designs.

### Module 2: Longitudinal Autopilot

-   Analysis of **Displacement Autopilots**.
-   **Pitch Orientation Control**, **Acceleration Control**, and **Flight Path Stabilization** systems.
-   **Glide Slope Couplers** and **Automatic Flare Control**.

### Module 3: Lateral Autopilot

-   **Damping of the Dutch Roll** and methods for obtaining turn coordination.
-   **Yaw Orientation Control** systems and **turn compensation**.
-   Introduction to **Fly-by-Wire (FBW)** flight control systems.

### Module 4: Missile and Launch Vehicle Guidance

-   Operating principles and design of **guidance laws**.
-   **Homing guidance** for short, medium, and BVR missiles.
-   **Implicit and explicit guidance schemes** for launch vehicles.
