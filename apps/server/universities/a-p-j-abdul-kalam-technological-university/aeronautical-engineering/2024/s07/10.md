## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Hypersonic Flow Theories

-   Introduction to **hypersonic shock and expansion wave relations**.
-   **Newtonian flow model**, modified Newtonian theory, and tangent wedge/cone methods.
-   Concepts of **hypersonic similarity** and **blast wave theory**.

### Module 2: Hypersonic Boundary Layer

-   **Hypersonic boundary layer** equations and similarity parameters.
-   Analysis of **aerodynamic heating**, **viscous interaction**, and **shock wave boundary layer interaction**.

### Module 3: Chemically Reacting Gases and Equilibrium Flows

-   Classification of gases (calorically perfect, thermally perfect, chemically reacting).
-   Basics of statistical thermodynamics and kinetic theory.
-   Analysis of **equilibrium inviscid flows** across normal/oblique shocks, in nozzles, and over blunt bodies.

### Module 4: Non-Equilibrium Flows

-   Analysis of **non-equilibrium flows** across normal/oblique shock waves and in 1-D nozzles.
-   **Speed of sound** in non-equilibrium flows.
-   Introduction to **radiative gas dynamics**.
