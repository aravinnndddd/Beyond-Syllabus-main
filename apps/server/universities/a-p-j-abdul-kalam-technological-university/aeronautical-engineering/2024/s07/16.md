# PEAOT758 - Stability and Control in Aircraft

## Course Objectives

-   To introduce a variety of study techniques and strategies for comprehending the fundamental ideas behind **aircraft stability and control**.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Aircraft Stability & Control

-   Introduction to **static and dynamic stability**.
-   **Aircraft coordinate systems**, degrees of freedom, and the basic equations of equilibrium.
-   The need for stability and the purpose of controls.

### Module 2: Longitudinal Control and Stability

-   Contributions of the **wing, tail, and fuselage** towards static longitudinal stability.
-   Effect of the **center of gravity (C.G.)** location on stability.
-   **Elevator control** and effectiveness, including stick-fixed and stick-free neutral points.

### Module 3: Control Surface Forces and Lateral Stability

-   **Hinge moment coefficient** and the aerodynamic balancing of control surfaces.
-   Lateral stability concepts like the **dihedral effect** and **adverse aileron yaw**.
-   Roll control, **weathercock effect**, and rudder requirements.
-   Introduction to **Phugoid motion**.

### Module 4: Stability Derivatives and Dynamic Stability

-   Introduction to **stability derivatives** and stability analysis using **Routh's discriminant**.
-   Analysis of dynamic stability modes: **Dutch roll**, **directional divergence**, and **spiral instability**.
-   Concepts of **autorotation and spin**.
