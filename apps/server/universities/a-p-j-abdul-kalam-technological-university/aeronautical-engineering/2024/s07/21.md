# OEAOT725 - Advanced Flight Mechanics

## Course Objectives

-   To understand **airplane performance** and how aircraft respond to different flight conditions and changes.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Speed Measurements and Drag Analysis

-   Measurement of **airspeed and Mach number**.
-   Analysis of various types of **drag** and the **drag polar curve**.
-   Introduction to the **equations of motion** for an aircraft.

### Module 2: Airplane Performance

-   Analysis of **steady flight**, including calculations for **range and endurance**.
-   Performance during **climb, turn, glide, take-off, and landing**.
-   Comparison of performance for turbojet and turboprop aircraft.

### Module 3: Static Stability

-   Concepts of **static and dynamic stability**.
-   **Static longitudinal stability**, including the contribution of individual components, the **neutral point**, and the **static margin**.
-   Introduction to **stability derivatives** and **Phugoid motion**.

### Module 4: Aircraft Dynamics

-   **Lateral-directional stability**: Dihedral effect and weathercock stability.
-   **Aileron and rudder control**, including aileron reversal.
-   Dynamic modes: **Dutch roll, spiral and directional divergence, autorotation, and spin**.
