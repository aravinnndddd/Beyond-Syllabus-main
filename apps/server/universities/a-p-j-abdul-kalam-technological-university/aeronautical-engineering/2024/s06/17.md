## Course Objectives

-   To understand the **fundamental principles and processes** involved in aircraft design.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Review of Developments in Aviation

-   **Categories and types of aircraft**, their configurations, and layouts.
-   Structural requirements for **strength, stiffness, fail-safe, and fatigue**.
-   **Manoeuvring load factors** and **gust envelopes**.

### Module 2: Power Plant and Preliminary Design

-   Types and characteristics of different **power plants** and propeller selection.
-   **Preliminary design** process: weight estimation, balance diagram, and drag estimation.
-   Performance calculations for **range, endurance, take-off, and landing**.

### Module 3: Special Problems in Aircraft Design

-   Layout peculiarities of **subsonic and supersonic aircraft**.
-   **Optimization of wing loading** to achieve desired performance.
-   Analysis of **loads on undercarriages** and their design requirements.

### Module 4: Structural Design
