## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Wind Tunnels & Model Testing

-   Functional parts of a wind tunnel and the principles of **model testing**.
-   Importance of **non-dimensional numbers**, scale effect, and **geometric, kinematic, and dynamic similarities**.
-   Sizing and design parameters for wind tunnels across different speed regimes.

### Module 2: Calibration of Wind Tunnels

-   **Calibration procedures** for subsonic and supersonic tunnels.
-   Measurement of test section speed, horizontal buoyancy, flow angularities, flow uniformity, and **turbulence levels**.

### Module 3: Conventional Measurement Techniques

-   **Force measurements** using multi-component internal and external balances.
-   Techniques for steady and unsteady **pressure measurement**.
-   **Velocity measurement** using intrusive and non-intrusive methods, including **Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)**.

### Module 4: Flow Visualization Techniques

-   Introduction to the necessity of **flow visualization**.
-   Techniques such as surface tufts, oil film, smoke, and hydrogen bubble.
-   **Optical methods** including **schlieren**, **shadowgraph**, and **interferometry**.
