## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Astronomy

-   **Astronomical coordinate systems**, time, and observable quantities.
-   **Stellar parameters**: Brightness, luminosity, magnitude, color, temperature, and size.
-   **Spectral classification**, the **H-R Diagram**, and the effects of solar radiation.

### Module 2: Solar System and its Exploration

-   Study of **planets, satellites, and their orbits**.
-   Physical and chemical characteristics of solar system bodies, including **comets and asteroids**.
-   Analysis of **space imagery** of planets and their environments.

### Module 3: Earth's Atmospheric Environment

-   Elements of **Earth’s magnetic field** and coordinate systems.
-   The terrestrial upper atmosphere, including the **thermosphere and exosphere**.
-   The **ionosphere**, including the production of ionization by solar radiation.

### Module 4: Space Weather

-   Interaction of the **solar wind** with the terrestrial magnetic field, forming the magnetosphere.
-   **Magnetospheric current systems**, the ring current, and plasma convection.
-   Phenomena like **aurorae**, magnetic storms, and the importance of **space weather** applications.
