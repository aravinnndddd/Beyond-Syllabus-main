---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Aircraft Propulsion

-   Review of **Thermodynamic Cycles** related to propulsion.
-   Components and working principles of various engines: **Propeller engines, Turbojets, Turboprops, Turbofans, and Ramjets**.
-   Comparison of different propulsion systems.

### Module 2: Jet Engine Compressors and Turbines

-   Principles and operation of **centrifugal and axial flow compressors**.
-   Analysis using **velocity diagrams**, work done, degree of reaction, and stage efficiency.
-   Study of **axial and radial flow turbines**, including blade cooling methods.

### Module 3: Combustor, Turbine, and Nozzle Design

-   Design of **combustion chambers** (Can, Annular, Can-Annular), focusing on flame stabilization and cooling.
-   **Turbine design** considerations, including blade design and structural integrity.
-   **Nozzle and exhaust design** for thrust augmentation and noise reduction.

### Module 4: Performance Metrics and Testing
