# AOT372: Non-Destructive Testing

## Course Objectives

- Introduce the basic principles, techniques, equipment, applications, and limitations of NDT methods such as Visual, Penetrant Testing, Magnetic Particle Testing, Ultrasonic Testing, Radiography, and Eddy Current.
- Enable selection of appropriate NDT methods.
- Identify advantages and limitations of nondestructive testing methods.
- Create awareness about developments and future trends in NDT.
- Differentiate various defect types and select appropriate NDT methods for the specimen.
