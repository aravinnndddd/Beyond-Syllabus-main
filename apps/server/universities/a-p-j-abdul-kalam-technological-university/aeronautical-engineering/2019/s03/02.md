# AOT201:Mechanics of Materials and Aircraft Materials

## Course Objectives

- Explain the fundamental concepts of deformable solids in the perspective of stress and strain.
- Design various kinds of axial loaded members under different boundary conditions.
- Calculate the loads in beams, forces and moments associated with different sections.
- Illustrate the theory, principles associated to bending of beam and twisting of shaft and apply the principles of bi-axial state of stresses in various problems through analytical and graphical methods.
- Explain properties associated with aircraft materials.
