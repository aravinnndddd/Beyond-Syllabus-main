# ERT445: OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: write java programs using the object-oriented concepts - classes, objects, constructors, inheritance and polymorphism  
- **co 2**: utilize datatypes, operators, control statements, built-in packages & interfaces, input/output streams and files in java to develop programs  
- **co 3**: illustrate how robust programs can be written in java using exception handling mechanism  
- **co 4**: write application programs in java using multithreading and database connectivity  
- **co 5**: write graphical user interface based application programs by utilizing event handling features and swing in java  

## syllabus

### module 1: introduction
- basic object-oriented concepts  
- object modeling using unified modeling language (uml) – uml diagrams, use case model, class diagram, activity diagram  
- introduction to java - java programming and runtime environment, development platforms - java virtual machine (jvm), java compiler, bytecode, java buzzwords, java program structure, comments  
- primitive data types - integers, floating point types, characters, boolean  
- literals, type conversion and casting, variables, arrays, strings, vector class  
- operators - arithmetic, bitwise, relational, boolean logical, assignment, conditional (ternary), operator precedence  
- control statements - selection, iteration and jump statements  

### module 2: core java fundamentals
- object oriented programming in java - class fundamentals, declaring objects, introduction to methods, constructors, `this` keyword, method overloading, access control, static members, final variables  
- inheritance - super class, sub class, `super` keyword, protected members, method overriding, object class, abstract classes and methods  

### module 3: more features of java
- packages and interfaces - defining package, importing packages, interfaces  
- exception handling - checked and unchecked exceptions, `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`, nested `try`, multiple `catch` clauses  
- input/output - i/o basics, reading console input, writing console output, print writer class, object streams and serialization, working with files  

### module 4: advanced features of java
- java library - string handling – constructors, length, special operations (character extraction, comparison, searching, modifying), using `valueOf()`  
- multithreaded programming - java thread model, main thread, creating threads, multiple threads, synchronization, suspending, resuming, stopping threads  

### module 5: graphical user interface and database support of java
- swing fundamentals - swing controls, components and containers, swing packages  
- event handling in swings, swing layout managers, exploring swings – `jframe`, `jlabel`, swing buttons, `jtextfield`  
- java database connectivity (jdbc) - overview, creating and executing queries – create table, delete, insert, select
