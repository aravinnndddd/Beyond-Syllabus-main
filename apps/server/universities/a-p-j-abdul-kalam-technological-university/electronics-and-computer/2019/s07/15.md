# ERT444: COMPILER DESIGN

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: explain the phases in compilation process (lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization and code generation) and model a lexical analyzer  
- **co 2**: model language syntax using context free grammar and develop parse tree representation using leftmost and rightmost derivations  
- **co 3**: compare different types of parsers (bottom-up and top-down) and construct parser for a given grammar  
- **co 4**: build syntax directed translation for a context free grammar, compare various storage allocation strategies and classify intermediate representations  
- **co 5**: illustrate code optimization and code generation techniques in compilation  

## syllabus

### module 1: introduction to compilers and lexical analysis

- analysis of the source program  
- analysis and synthesis phases  
- phases of a compiler  
- lexical analysis: role of lexical analyzer, input buffering  
- specification of tokens  
- recognition of tokens  

### module 2: introduction to syntax analysis

- role of the syntax analyser  
- review of context free grammars  
- derivation and parse trees  
- basic parsing approaches: eliminating left recursion, left factoring

### module 4: syntax directed translation and intermediate code generation

- syntax directed translation: syntax directed definitions, s-attributed definitions, l-attributed definitions  
- storage organization  
- storage-allocation strategies  
- intermediate code generation: intermediate languages, graphical representations, three-address code, quadruples, triples  

### module 5: code optimization and generation

- code optimization: principal sources of optimization, local and global optimizations  
- code generation: issues in the design of a code generator, target language, a simple code generator
