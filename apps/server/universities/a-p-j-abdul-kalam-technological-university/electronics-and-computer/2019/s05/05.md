# CST309: MANAGEMENT OF SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: demonstrate traditional and agile software development approaches  
- **co 2**: prepare software requirement specification and software design for a given problem  
- **co 3**: justify the significance of design patterns and licensing terms in software development, prepare testing, maintenance and devops strategies for a project  
- **co 4**: make use of software project management concepts while planning, estimation, scheduling, tracking and change management of a project, with a traditional/agile framework  
- **co 5**: utilize sqa practices, process improvement techniques and technology advancements in cloud based software models and containers & microservices
