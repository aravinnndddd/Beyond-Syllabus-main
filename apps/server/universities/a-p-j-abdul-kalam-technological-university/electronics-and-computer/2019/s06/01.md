# ERT302: OPERATING SYSTEMS

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: explain the relevance, structure and functions of operating systems in computing devices  
- **co 2**: illustrate the concepts of process management and process scheduling mechanisms employed in operating systems  
- **co 3**: explain process synchronization in operating systems and illustrate process synchronization mechanisms using mutex locks, semaphores and monitors  
- **co 4**: explain any one method for detection, prevention, avoidance and recovery for managing deadlocks in operating systems  
- **co 5**: explain the memory management algorithms in operating systems  
- **co 6**: explain the security aspects and algorithms for file and storage management in operating systems  

## syllabus

### module 1: introduction

- operating system overview – operations, functions, services  
- system calls  
- types of operating systems  
- os structure: simple structure, layered approach, microkernel, modules  
- system boot process  

### module 2: process and scheduling

- processes: process states, process control block, threads  
- operations: process creation and termination  
- inter-process communication: shared memory and message passing systems  
- scheduling: basic concepts, criteria, algorithms (fcfs, sjf, priority, round robin)  

### module 3: process synchronization and deadlocks

- synchronization: race conditions, critical section problem, peterson’s solution  
- synchronization tools: synchronization hardware, mutex locks, semaphores, monitors  
- classical problems: producer-consumer, dining philosophers, readers-writers  
- deadlocks: necessary conditions, resource allocation graphs  
- deadlock handling: prevention, avoidance (banker’s algorithm), detection, recovery  

### module 4: memory management

- concepts: address spaces, swapping  
- memory allocation: contiguous (fixed and variable), segmentation, paging  
- virtual memory: demand paging, page replacement algorithms  

### module 5: file and storage management

- file system: file attributes, operations, types, structure, access methods, protection  
- implementation: file system implementation, directory implementation, allocation methods  
- storage: magnetic disks, solid-state disks, disk structure, scheduling, formatting
