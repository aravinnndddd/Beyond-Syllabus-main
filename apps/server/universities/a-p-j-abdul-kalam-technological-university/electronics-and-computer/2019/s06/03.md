# ERT306: DATA COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: understand data communication and networking using the layered concept, open system interconnect (osi) and the tcp/ip model  
- **co 2**: illustrate various types of encoding techniques and error detection methods used in networks  
- **co 3**: use the concept of multiplexing, switching and routing in networks  
- **co 4**: discuss the working principles of lan and the concepts behind congestion in networks  
- **co 5**: recognize the principles and operations of internetworking and various protocols used
