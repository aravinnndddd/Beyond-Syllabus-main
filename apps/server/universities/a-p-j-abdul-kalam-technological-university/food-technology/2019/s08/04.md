# FTT402: FOOD PLANT LAYOUT AND DESIGN

## Course Outcomes
- **CO1**: Design efficient layouts for food processing plants considering workflow optimization
- **CO2**: Select appropriate equipment based on production requirements and hygienic standards
- **CO3**: Implement regulatory compliance in plant design (FSSAI, GMP, ISO standards)
- **CO4**: Develop material handling systems for raw materials and finished products
- **CO5**: Integrate sanitation and safety systems in plant infrastructure
