# MET312: Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

## Course Objectives
* co1 Understand the fundamentals of surface NDT for inspection following established procedures  
* co2 Differentiate defect types and select appropriate NDT methods  
* co3 Calibrate instruments and evaluate components for imperfections  
* co4 Understand ultrasonic testing principles and inspect samples  
* co5 Comprehend radiographic testing, interpretation, and evaluation  

## Course Contents
