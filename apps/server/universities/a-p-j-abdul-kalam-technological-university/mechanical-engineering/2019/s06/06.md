# MET352: Automobile Engineering

## Course Objectives
This course provides mechanical engineering students with knowledge of automotive systems, subsystems, and emerging technologies in electric vehicles, along with an understanding of vehicle aerodynamics.
* co1 explain different automotive systems and subsystems  
* co2 illustrate the principles of transmission, suspension, steering, and braking systems of an automobile  
* co3 build a basic knowledge about the technology in electric vehicles  
* co4 summarize the concept of aerodynamics in automobiles
