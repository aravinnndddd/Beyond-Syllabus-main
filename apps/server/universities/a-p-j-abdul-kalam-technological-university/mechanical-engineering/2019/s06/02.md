# MET304: Dynamics and Design of Machinery

## Course Objectives

* co1 do engine force analysis and to draw turning moment diagrams  
* co2 analyse free and forced vibrations of single degree of freedom systems  
* co3 determine the natural frequencies of a two degree of freedom vibrating system and calculate the stresses in a structural member due to combined loading  
* co4 design machine elements subjected to fatigue loading and riveted joints  
* co5 design welded joints and close coiled helical compression springs  

## Course Content

### Module 1
