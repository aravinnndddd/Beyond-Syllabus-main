# MET362: Product Design and Development

## Course Objectives

* co1 determine the life cycle of a product and the product development process  
* co2 develop knowledge of robust design and conceptual design  
* co3 introduce the concept of design for manufacturing and assembly in product design  
* co4 use value engineering in the development of a product  
* co5 incorporate ergonomics and rapid prototyping in product development  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction
* classification and specifications of products, product life cycle, product mix  
* introduction to product design, modern product development process: design by evolution, design by innovation, morphology of design  
* ethics in product design, legal factors, and social issues  

### Module 2: Creativity Techniques and Conceptual Design
* creative thinking, conceptualization, brainstorming, primary design, drawing, simulation, detail design  
* conceptual design: generation, selection, and embodiment of concept, product architecture
