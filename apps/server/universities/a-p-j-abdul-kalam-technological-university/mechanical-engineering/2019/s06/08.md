# MET332: Advanced Mechanics of Solids

## Course Objectives

* co1 formulate the field equations of elasticity  
* co2 model engineering problems as two-dimensional using stress functions  
* co3 develop solutions for axi-symmetric problems in thick pressure vessels and rotating circular discs  
* co4 extend concepts of elastic flexure for skewed loading and curved beams  
* co5 apply solution methods for torsion in non-circular cross sections and thin-walled structures  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Field Equations of Elasticity
* equations of equilibrium in rectangular and cylindrical polar coordinates  
* strain-displacement relations and constitutive equations  
* boundary value problems: displacement and force formulation  
* compatibility equations, uniqueness of solution, superposition, St. Venant’s principle  

### Module 2: Two-Dimensional Problems in Elasticity
* stress-strain relations for plane stress and plane strain cases  
* Airy’s stress functions for solving stresses in rectangular and polar coordinates  
* contact stresses due to concentrated normal force and uniform normal pressure  

### Module 3: Axisymmetric Problems
* thin cylinders pressurized from inside  
* thick cylinders pressurized from inside and outside  
* rotating disks  

### Module 4: Unsymmetrical Bending
* bending of straight beams with two axes of symmetry  
* shear center  
* Winkler-Bach theory for bending of curved beams (rectangular cross-section)  

### Module 5: Torsion of Non-Circular Bars
* St. Venant’s and Prandtl’s methods
