# MET307: Machine Tools and Metrology

## Course Objectives

This course introduces the fundamentals of machining processes, machine tools and metrology. It emphasizes the principles of machining, calculation of machining parameters, tool nomenclature, limitations of machining processes and surface texture. The course also covers mechanical measurements, precision instruments, gauges and advanced metrology tools.  

* Analyze various machining processes and calculate relevant quantities such as velocities, forces and powers (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)  
* Analyze the tool nomenclature with surface roughness obtainable in each machining process (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)  
* Understand the limitations of various machining processes with regard to shape formation and surface texture (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Demonstrate knowledge of the underlying principles of measurement, mechanical measurement, electronic instrumentation, and thermal effects (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Gain exposure to advanced measuring devices and machine tool metrology (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
