# MET301: Mechanics of Machinery

## Course Objectives

This course aims to introduce the students to the fundamentals of the kinematics of various mechanisms and its analysis for displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The course also covers the design of cams, theory and analysis of gears, gear trains, and synthesis of mechanisms. The static force analysis of planar mechanisms and concept of gyroscopic couple with its effects are included. The course aids students in estimating unbalance in rotating and reciprocating masses and suggesting methods to overcome it.  

* Explain the fundamentals of kinematics, various planar mechanisms and interpret the basic principles of mechanisms and machines (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Perform analysis and synthesis of mechanisms (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Solve problems on cams and gear drives, including selection depending on requirement (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Calculate the gyroscopic effect in various situations (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)  
* Analyse rotating and reciprocating masses for their unbalance (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)
