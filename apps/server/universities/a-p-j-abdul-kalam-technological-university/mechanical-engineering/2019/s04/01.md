# MAT202: Probability, Statistics and Numerical Methods

## Course Objectives

This course introduces students to the modern theory of probability and statistics, covering important models of random variables and techniques of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. A brief course in numerical methods familiarises students with some basic numerical techniques for finding roots of equations, evaluating definite integrals, solving systems of linear equations, and solving ordinary differential equations which are especially useful when analytical solutions are hard to find.

* Understand the concept, properties and important models of discrete random variables and analyse suitable random phenomena (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Understand the concept, properties and important models of continuous random variables and analyse suitable random phenomena (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Perform statistical inferences concerning characteristics of a population based on attributes of samples drawn from the population (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Compute roots of equations, evaluate definite integrals and perform interpolation on given numerical data using standard numerical techniques (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Apply standard numerical techniques for solving systems of equations, fitting curves on given numerical data and solving ordinary differential equations (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
