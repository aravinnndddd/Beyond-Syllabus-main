# MET204: Manufacturing Process

## Course Objectives

1. To gain theoretical and practical knowledge in material casting processes and develop an understanding of the dependent and independent variables which control materials casting in a production process.  
2. Provide a detailed discussion on the welding process and the physics of welding. Introduce students to different welding processes, weld testing and advanced processes to be able to appreciate the practical applications of welding.  
3. Provide methods of analysis allowing a mathematical/physical description of forming processes.  
4. Correlate the material type with the possible fabrication processes.  
5. Generate solutions to problems that may arise in manufacturing engineering.  

* Illustrate the basic principles of foundry practices and special casting processes, their advantages, limitations and applications (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Categorize welding processes according to welding principle and material (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Understand requirements to achieve sound welded joint while welding different similar and dissimilar engineering materials (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Estimate the working loads for pressing, forging, wire drawing etc. processes (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Recommend appropriate part manufacturing processes when provided a set of functional requirements and product development constraints (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
