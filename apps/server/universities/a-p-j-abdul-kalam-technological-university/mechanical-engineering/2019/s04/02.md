# MET202: Engineering Thermodynamics

## Course Objectives

Thermodynamics is the study of energy. Without energy life cannot exist. Activities from breathing to the launching of rockets involve energy transactions and are subject to thermodynamic analysis. Engineering devices like engines, turbines, refrigeration and air conditioning systems, propulsion systems etc., work on energy transformations and must be analysed using principles of thermodynamics. So, a thorough knowledge of thermodynamic concepts is essential for a mechanical engineer. This course offers an introduction to the basic concepts and laws of thermodynamics.

* Understand basic concepts and laws of thermodynamics (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Conduct first law analysis of open and closed systems (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Determine entropy and availability changes associated with different processes (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Understand the application and limitations of different equations of state (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Determine change in properties of pure substances during phase change processes (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Evaluate properties of ideal gas mixtures (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
