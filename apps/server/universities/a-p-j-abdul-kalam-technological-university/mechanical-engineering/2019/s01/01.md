## Course Objectives

* Solve systems of linear equations, diagonalize matrices and characterise quadratic forms (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Compute the partial and total derivatives and maxima and minima of multivariable functions (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Compute multiple integrals and apply them to find areas and volumes of geometrical shapes, mass and centre of gravity of plane laminas (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Perform various tests to determine whether a given series is convergent, absolutely convergent or conditionally convergent (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyze)  
* Determine the Taylor and Fourier series expansion of functions and learn their applications (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
