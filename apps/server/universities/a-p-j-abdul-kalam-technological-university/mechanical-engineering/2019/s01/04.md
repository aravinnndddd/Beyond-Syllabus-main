# EST100: Engineering Mechanics

## Course Objectives

This course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in the principles of mechanics. It introduces basic statics and dynamics of rigid bodies, enabling learners to analyze real-world engineering problems involving force systems, friction, centroid and moment of inertia, and rigid body motion. The course enhances spatial visualization and problem-solving skills necessary for further studies in mechanical engineering.

* Recall principles and theorems related to rigid body mechanics (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Remember)  
* Identify and describe the components of system of forces acting on the rigid body (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Apply the conditions of equilibrium to various practical problems involving different force systems (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Choose appropriate theorems, principles or formulae to solve problems of mechanics (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Solve problems involving rigid bodies, applying the properties of distributed areas and masses (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
