# EST110: Engineering Graphics

## Course Objectives

To enable the student to effectively perform technical communication through graphical representation as per global standards.

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Orthographic Projection of Points and Lines)
* Introduction: Relevance of technical drawing in engineering field  
* Types of lines, dimensioning, BIS code of practice for technical drawing  
* Projection of points in different quadrants  
* Projection of straight lines inclined to one plane and inclined to both planes  
* Trace of line, inclination of lines with reference planes  
* True length of line inclined to both the reference planes  

### Module - 2 (Orthographic Projection of Solids)
* Projection of simple solids: Triangular, Rectangular, Square, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal Prisms, Pyramids, Cone, and Cylinder  
* Projection of solids in simple position including profile view  
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to one of the reference planes  
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to both reference planes  

### Module - 3 (Sections of Solids)
* Sections of Prisms, Pyramids, Cone, Cylinder with axis in vertical position and cut by different section planes  
* True shape of the sections  
* Locating the section plane when the true shape of the section is given  

### Module - 4 (Development of Surfaces)
