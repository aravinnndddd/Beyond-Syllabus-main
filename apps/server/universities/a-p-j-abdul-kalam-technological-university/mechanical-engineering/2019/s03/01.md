# MAT201: Partial Differential Equations and Complex Analysis

## Course Objectives

This course introduces basic ideas of partial differential equations which are widely used in the modelling and analysis of a wide range of physical phenomena and has applications across all branches of engineering. It also develops an understanding of the basic theory of functions of a complex variable, residue integration and conformal transformation.

* Understand the concept and the solution of partial differential equation (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Analyse and solve one dimensional wave equation and heat equation (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Understand complex functions, its continuity and differentiability using Cauchy-Riemann equations (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Evaluate complex integrals using Cauchy’s integral theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula, understand the series expansion of analytic function (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Understand the series expansion of complex function about a singularity and apply residue theorem to compute several kinds of real integrals (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
