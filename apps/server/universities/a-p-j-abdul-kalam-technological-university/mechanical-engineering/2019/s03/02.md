# MET201: Mechanics of Solids

## Course Objectives

This course helps the students to understand the concept of stress and strain in different types of structure/machine under various loading conditions. The course also covers simple and compound stresses due to forces, stresses and deflection in beams due to bending, torsion in circular section, strain energy, different theories of failure, stress in thin cylinder thick cylinder and spheres due to external and internal pressure.

* Determine the stresses, strains and displacements of structures by tensorial and graphical (Mohr’s circle) approaches (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Analyse the strength of materials using stress-strain relationships for structural and thermal loading (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)  
* Perform basic design of shafts subjected to torsional loading and analyse beams subjected to bending moments (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Determine the deformation of structures subjected to various loading conditions using strain energy methods (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Analyse column buckling and appreciate the theories of failures and its relevance in engineering design (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)
