# MET205: Metallurgy and Material Science

## Course Objectives

Understanding of the correlation between the chemical bonds and crystal structure of metallic materials to their mechanical properties. Recognize the importance of crystal imperfections including dislocations in plastic deformation. Learning about different phases and heat treatment methods to tailor the properties of Fe-C alloys. Examine the mechanisms of materials failure through fatigue and creep. To determine properties of unknown materials and develop an awareness to apply this knowledge in material design.

* Understand the basic chemical bonds, crystal structures (BCC, FCC, and HCP), and their relationship with the properties (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Analyze the microstructure of metallic materials using phase diagrams and modify the microstructure and properties using different heat treatments (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyse)  
* Quantify mechanical integrity and failure in materials (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Apply the basic principles of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy for selecting materials for specific applications (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Define and differentiate engineering materials on the basis of structure and properties for engineering applications (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)
