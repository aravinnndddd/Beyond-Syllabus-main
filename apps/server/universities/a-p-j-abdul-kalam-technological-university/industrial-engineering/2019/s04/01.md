# Introduction to Stochastic Models

## course outcomes

- **CO1**: Develop techniques to compute probabilities of discrete distributions and selectively apply them to solve real-world problems.
- **CO2**: Develop techniques to compute probabilities of continuous distributions and selectively apply them to solve real-world problems.
- **CO3**: Analyse joint distributions, correlations, and collective behaviour of multiple random variables.
- **CO4**: Explore stochastic phenomena using appropriate tools and models like Poisson processes.
- **CO5**: Develop Markov chain models of selected real
