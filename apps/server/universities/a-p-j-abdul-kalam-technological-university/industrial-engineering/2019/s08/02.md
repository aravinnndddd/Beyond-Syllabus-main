# Programming and Data Analytics with R

## course objectives
- To develop proficiency in R programming and data handling.  
- To apply statistical concepts and predictive modeling techniques using R.

## syllabus

### Module 1: R Fundamentals (9 hours)
- Installing and setting up R and RStudio.  
- Understanding R data types: numeric, character, logical, factors.  
- Working with vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames.  
- Reading and writing data from/to CSV, Excel, and text files.  
- Basic R syntax, arithmetic operations, and object assignments.

### Module 2: Advanced R Programming (9 hours)
- Creating and using functions in R.  
- Control structures: if-else, for loops, while loops, apply family functions.  
- Object-oriented programming: S3, S4, and R6 classes.  
- Integrating C++ code with R using Rcpp for performance optimization.  
- Error handling and debugging techniques.

### Module 3: Data Manipulation (9 hours)
- Data wrangling with `dplyr` and the `tidyverse` ecosystem.  
- Data reshaping with `tidyr` (gather, spread, pivot).  
- String manipulation with `stringr`.  
- Working with dates and times using `lubridate`.  
- Time series analysis with `xts` and `zoo`.

### Module 4: Statistical Analysis (9 hours)
- Probability distributions and their applications.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization (ggplot2).  
- Linear regression: simple and multiple regression models.  
- Multivariate statistical methods: PCA, factor analysis.  
- Time series modelling and forecasting basics.
