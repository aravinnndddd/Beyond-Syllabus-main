## syllabus

### Module 1: General Features and Design of Supply Chains
- Supply Chain â€“ objectives, structures, decision phases, performance measures, strategic fit, drivers and metrics.  
- Design of distribution networks and models for facility location and layout decisions.  
- Features of postponement, mass customisation, supply chain restructuring, lean, agile, leagile, resilient, dual channel and international supply chains.  

### Module 2: Planning and Control Decisions in Production Chains
- Forecasting models for supply chains including seasonal models, forecast errors, de-seasonalization.  
- Aggregate Planning: strategies, methods, models with quantitative examples.  
- Operations planning for predictable variability in production chains using sequencing, scheduling and line balancing.  

### Module 3: Material Flow Decisions in Supply Chains
- Cycle inventory models, discounting models, multi-item and production-consumption models for supply chains (including multi-echelon systems).  
- Safety inventory models for continuous and periodic review for single and multi-items with probabilistic demand, including multi-echelon systems.  
- Tools for optimal product availability, bullwhip effect reduction, and risk pooling.  

### Module 4: Logistics Network Design Decisions
- Transportation network design options, trade-offs, risk management.  
- 3PL, 4PL, and 5PL concepts.  
- Methods for allocation, routing, scheduling, sequencing in transportation.  
- Vehicle routing problem formulation and solutions with quantitative examples.  

### Module 5: Multi-stage, Reverse, Closed Loop and Green Logistics Design
- Mathematical formulation and solution of multi-stage transportation problems with node capacities.  
- Advanced logistics decision models: bin packing, fixed charge, knapsack problems.  
- Methods and tools for reverse, closed loop, and green logistics in uncertain situations (e.g., Covid scenario).
