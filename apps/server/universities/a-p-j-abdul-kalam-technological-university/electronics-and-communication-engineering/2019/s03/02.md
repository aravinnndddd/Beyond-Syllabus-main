# MAT201: Partial Differential Equations and Complex Analysis

## Course Objectives

- To provide a strong foundation in partial differential equations and their solutions using standard techniques.
- To enable students to formulate and solve engineering problems modeled by one-dimensional wave and heat equations.
- To develop an understanding of complex-valued functions, their differentiability, and analytic nature.
- To introduce complex integration and use of Cauchy’s integral theorem and Cauchy’s integral formula.
- To study series expansions of complex functions and evaluate real integrals using residue theorem.

## Course Content

### Module - 1

- Formation of partial differential equations:
 - Elimination of arbitrary constants and arbitrary functions.
- Solutions of partial differential equations.
- Equations solvable by direct integration.
- Linear equations of the first order – Lagrange’s linear equation.
- Non-linear equations of the first order – Charpit’s method.
- Solution of equations by method of separation of variables.

### Module - 2

- One-dimensional wave equation:
- Vibrations of a stretched string.
- Derivation and solution using method of separation of variables.
- D’Alembert’s solution.
- One-dimensional heat equation:
- Derivation and solution.

### Module - 3

- Complex function, limit, continuity, derivative.
- Analytic functions, Cauchy-Riemann equations.
- Harmonic functions, finding harmonic conjugates.
- Conformal mappings:
  - \( w = z^2 \), \( w = e^z \), \( w = \frac{1}{z} \), \( w = \sin z \).
  - Linear fractional transformations and fixed points.

### Module - 4

- Complex integration.
- Line integrals in the complex plane, basic properties.
- Evaluation methods:
- Indefinite integration and substitution of limits.
- Use of path representation.
- Contour integrals.
- Cauchy integral theorem (without proof) on simply and multiply connected domains.
- Cauchy integral formula (without proof).
- Cauchy integral formula for derivatives of an analytic function.
- Taylor’s and Maclaurin series.

### Module - 5
- Laurent’s series (without proof).
- Zeros of analytic functions.
- Singularities: poles, removable and essential singularities.
- Residues, Cauchy Residue Theorem (without proof).
- Evaluation of definite integrals using residue theorem.
- Residue integration of real integrals:
- Rational functions of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \).
- Improper integrals of the form \( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx \) (no poles on real axis).
- Note: \( \int_A^B f(x)\,dx \) with singularities on interval is excluded from syllabus.
