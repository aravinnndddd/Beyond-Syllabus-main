# ECT203: Logic Circuit Design

## Course Objectives

- Explain the elements of digital system abstractions such as digital representations of information, digital logic and Boolean algebra.
- Create an implementation of a combinational logic function described by a truth table using AND/OR/INV gates or multiplexers.
- Compare different types of logic families with respect to performance and efficiency.
- Design a sequential logic circuit using the basic building blocks like flip-flops.
- Design and analyze combinational and sequential logic circuits through gate-level Verilog models.
