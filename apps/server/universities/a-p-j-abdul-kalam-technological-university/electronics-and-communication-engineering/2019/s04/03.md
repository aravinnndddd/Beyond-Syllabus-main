# ECT204: Signals and Systems

## Course Objectives

- To introduce the basic concepts of signals and systems and their classifications.  
- To familiarize students with various signal representations using series and transforms.  
- To develop an understanding of orthogonality of signals, convolution, and correlation.  
- To enable students to analyze Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems using transfer functions.  
- To introduce the concept of sampling and its implications on signal analysis.
