# PEECT524 - ARM Architecture and Programming

## Course Objectives

1. Introduce ARM Cortex-M programming in assembly and C.  
2. Lay the foundation for practical embedded system design.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
- Embedded C: Fixed-width integer data types in C99, boolean type, mixing types, manipulating bits in memory and I/O ports, accessing memory-mapped I/O using pointers, structures, packed structures, bit fields, casting address of an object, unions.  
- Review of computer organization: Memory, CPU, I/O.  
- Introduction to ARM Cortex-M architecture: Internal organization – general purpose and special registers, instruction pipelining, memory model, bit banding.  
- ARM assembly language instruction format and operands.

---

### Module 2
- ARM assembly language programming: Loading constants into registers, loading memory data into registers, storing data from registers to memory, converting C assignment statements to assembly.  
- Memory address calculations and examples: Translating C pointer expressions to assembly, translating C subscript expressions to assembly, translating structure references to assembly.  
- Stack instructions.  
- Data processing instructions: Updating flags in APSR, arithmetic instructions, bit manipulation instructions, shift instructions, bit field manipulation instructions.

---

### Module 3
- Control structures in assembly language: Instruction sequencing, conditional branch instructions, translating if-then and if-then-else statements to assembly, compound conditionals, implementing loops, speeding up array access.  
- Implementing functions: Function call and return, register usage, parameter passing, return values, temporary variables, preserving registers.

---

### Module 4
- I/O programming in assembly: Interrupts and exceptions, thread and handler modes, entering and returning from the exception handler, latency reduction techniques, priorities and nested exceptions, synchronization, transfer rate and latency, buffers and queues, double buffering, polled waiting loops, interrupt-driven I/O, DMA.  
- System initialization: Memory layout, CPU and vector table, C run-time environment, system timer.
