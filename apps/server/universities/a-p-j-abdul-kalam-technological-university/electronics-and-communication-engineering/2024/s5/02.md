- Amplitude modulation: Equation and spectrum of AM signal, DSB-SC, SSB - pilot carrier and Vestigial Sideband systems.  
- Angle modulation: Narrow and wide band FM and their spectra, relationship between FM and PM, Carson’s rule, pre-emphasis and de-emphasis filtering.  
- Comparison of AM and FM.  
- Block diagram of FM receiver.
