## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
- Review of sampling, Z-transform and DTFT.  
- The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT): DFT as a linear transformation (Matrix relation), IDFT, properties of DFT and examples (proof not necessary).  
- Circular convolution, linear convolution using circular convolution.  
- Filtering of long data sequences, overlap-save and overlap-add methods.  
- Frequency analysis of signals using the DFT (concept only).  

---

### Module 2
- Design of FIR filters: Symmetric and anti-symmetric FIR filters.  
- Design of linear phase FIR filters using window methods (rectangular, Hamming and Hanning).  
- Design of IIR digital filters from analog filters (Butterworth).  
- IIR filter design by impulse invariance and bilinear transformation.  
- Frequency transformations in the analog domain.  

---

### Module 3
- Structures for the realization of discrete-time systems: Block diagram and signal flow graph representations of filters.  
- FIR filter structures: Linear structures, direct form.  
- IIR filter structures: Direct form, transposed form, cascade form and parallel form.  
- Multirate digital signal processing: Decimation and interpolation (time domain and frequency domain interpretation), anti-aliasing and anti-imaging filter.  

---

### Module 4
- Efficient computation of DFT: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and computational advantage over DFT.  
- Radix-2 Decimation-in-Time FFT algorithm.
