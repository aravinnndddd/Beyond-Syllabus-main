## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
**CMOS Amplifiers**  
- MOS small signal model.  
- CMOS amplifiers: common source amplifier with resistive and active loads, common source amplifier with source degeneration, common gate and common drain amplifier (only voltage gain and input/output impedances).  
- Cascode amplifier: cascoded amplifier with cascode loads, folded cascode amplifier.  

---

### Module 2
**CMOS Differential Amplifiers**  
- MOS current mirror: basic circuit, PMOS and NMOS current mirrors, simple and cascode current mirror circuits.  
- CMOS differential amplifier: differential amplifier with resistive, current source, and current mirror loads.  
- MOS telescopic cascode amplifier (only voltage gain and input/output impedances).

### Module 3
**CMOS Operational Amplifier**  
- Two-stage operational amplifiers.  
- Frequency compensation of op-amps: Miller compensation.  
- Bandgap references: supply-independent biasing.  
- Temperature-independent references – bandgap reference.  

---

### Module 4
**Data Converters**  
- DAC specifications, ADC specifications.  
- DAC architectures: resistor string, R-2R ladder networks, current steering, charge scaling, cyclic, and pipeline types.  
- ADC architectures: flash type, successive approximation type, oversampling ADC.
