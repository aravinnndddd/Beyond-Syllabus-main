**Algebraic Foundations for Coding Theory**  
- Overview of groups, rings, finite fields – binary field arithmetic, primitive elements.  
- Irreducible and primitive polynomials, conjugate elements, minimal polynomials, field extension.  
- Construction of finite fields from polynomial rings.  
- Vector spaces – subspace and dual spaces, matrices.  

---

### Module 2
**Error Control Coding Basics**  
- Relevance of error control codes in communication systems.  
- Concepts: code rate, Hamming distance, minimum distance, error detecting and correcting capability.  
- Linear block codes (LBC): generator matrix, parity check matrix, maximum likelihood decoding, syndrome decoding.  
- Bounds on block codes: Singleton bound, Hamming bound, Gilbert–Varshamov bound.  
- Maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes.

### Module 3
**Cyclic and Structured Codes**  
- Basic concepts of cyclic codes – polynomial and matrix description, interrelation between polynomial and matrix viewpoints.  
- Encoding: non-systematic and systematic encoding, syndrome decoding, complete decoding of cyclic codes.  
- Hamming codes – properties and examples.  
- BCH codes and Reed–Solomon codes (properties and encoding only).

### Module 4
**Advanced Error Control Codes**  
- Convolutional codes: systematic encoders, Viterbi algorithm.  
- Turbo codes: encoding parallel concatenated codes.  
- Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes: construction, Tanner graphs, message passing decoding.
