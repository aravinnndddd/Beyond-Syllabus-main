## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
**Introduction to Real-Time Systems**  
- Overview of real-time systems: definition and types of real-time systems, hard vs. soft real-time systems.  
- Basic concepts: real-time tasks and their characteristics, task scheduling, timing constraints and requirements.  
- RTOS architectures: monolithic kernels vs. microkernels.  
- RTOS examples: commercial vs open RTOS and their comparison.  
- Inter-Process Communication (IPC): shared memory, message passing.  
- RTOS environment setup: installation and setup of an RTOS on a microcontroller (e.g., ARM Cortex-M).  
- Task creation and management: writing simple tasks, task states and transitions.  
- Scheduling and context switching: implementing basic scheduling algorithms, demonstrating context switching with example tasks.
