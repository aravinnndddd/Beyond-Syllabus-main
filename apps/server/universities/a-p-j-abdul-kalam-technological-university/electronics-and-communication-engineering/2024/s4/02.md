## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Signals and Systems
- Continuous-time and discrete-time signals – elementary signals, classification, and basic operations.  
- Continuous-time and discrete-time systems – representation and classification (memory, causal, stable, linear, time-invariant, invertible).  
- Convolution integral and convolution sum operations.  
- Continuous-time and discrete-time LTI systems – stability and causality.  

---

### Module 2: Frequency Domain Representation of Continuous-Time Signals
- Continuous-time Fourier series – exponential Fourier series representation of periodic signals.  
- Continuous-time Fourier transform – convergence, Gibbs phenomenon, transform of standard signals, properties, and inverse transform.  
- Bilateral Laplace transform – concept of ROC, relation to Fourier transform.

### Module 3: Sampling & Frequency Domain Representation of Discrete-Time Signals
- Conversion of continuous-time signals to discrete-time signals – sampling theorem for low-pass signals, Nyquist criteria, aliasing.  
- Discrete-time Fourier series for discrete periodic signals.  
- Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) – convergence conditions, DTFT of standard signals, properties, inverse transform.
