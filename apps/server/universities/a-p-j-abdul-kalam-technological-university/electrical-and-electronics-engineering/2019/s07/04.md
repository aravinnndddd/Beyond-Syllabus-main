# EET433: Modern Operating Systems  

## Course Objectives  
- Describe the key concepts of modern operating systems.  
- Apply the concepts of scheduling, resource management, and process synchronization for process management.  
- Evaluate the implementation of various memory management techniques.  
- Illustrate different file management and directory management methods.  
- Evaluate disk scheduling algorithms.  
- Explain RAID structures.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction and Process Management  
- Definition and structure of operating systems, operating system operations.  
- Process management, memory management, storage management, protection, and security.  
- User and operating system interface, system calls, types of system calls.  
- Computing environments, open-source operating systems.  
- Process concept, operations on processes, threads overview, and multithreading models.  

### Module 2 – CPU Scheduling and Process Synchronization  
- CPU scheduling: basic concepts, scheduling criteria, and algorithms (FCFS, SJF, SRTN, Round Robin, Priority scheduling).  
- Inter-process communication, race conditions, critical sections.  
- Mutual exclusion with busy waiting, sleep and wakeup, semaphores, mutexes.  
- Introduction to deadlocks.  

### Module 3 – Memory Management  
- Swapping and contiguous memory allocation.  
- Virtual memory, paging, page tables, TLBs.  
- Page replacement algorithms: Optimal, FIFO, Second Chance, Clock, LRU, Working Set.
