# EET415: Control Systems Engineering  

## Course Objectives  
- Identify the elements of control systems.  
- Develop transfer function models of systems.  
- Analyse the relation between pole locations and the transient response of first- and second-order systems.  
- Determine the stability of LTI systems.  
- Apply the concept of Root Locus to assess the performance of linear systems.  
- Determine the frequency domain specifications from Bode plot, Polar plot, and Nyquist plot.
