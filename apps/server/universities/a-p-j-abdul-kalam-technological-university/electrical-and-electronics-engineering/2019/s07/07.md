# EET463: Illumination Technology  

## Course Objectives  
- Explain the fundamental concepts of natural and artificial lighting schemes.  
- Design efficient indoor lighting systems.  
- Design efficient outdoor lighting systems.  
- Describe aesthetic and emergency lighting systems.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction of Light  
- Types of illumination: daylighting, artificial lighting, total lighting.  
- Quality of good lighting, factors affecting physical processes.  
- Light sources: incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, LPSV, HPSV, mercury vapour, metal halide, LED, modern trends.  
- Supplementary lighting: shadow, glare, reflection, colour rendering, stroboscopic effect.  
- Methods of artificial lighting and lighting systems – direct, indirect, semi-direct, semi-indirect.  
- Lighting schemes: general and localized.  
- Types of luminaires.  

### Module 2 – Measurement of Light  
- Definitions: luminous flux, luminous intensity, lumen, candle power, illumination, MHCP, MSCP, MHSCP, lamp efficiency, brightness.  
- Laws of illumination: inverse square law, Lambert’s cosine law.  
- Illumination at horizontal/vertical planes from point source.  
- Polar curves, luminance and illumination calculations for linear, round and flat sources.  
- Measuring apparatus – goniophotometer, integrating sphere, lux meter.  

### Module 3 – Design of Interior Lighting  
- Definitions: maintenance factor, uniformity ratio, direct ratio, coefficient of utilisation.  
- Illumination required for different work planes.  
- Fixtures and terms – DLOR, ULOR.  
- Lamp and luminance selection.  
- Calculation of lumen output considering voltage and temperature variations.  
- Wattage and number of lamps, lamp layout, spacing-to-mounting height ratio.  
- IS recommendations for illumination levels.  
- Special features for entrances, staircases, corridors, industrial buildings.  

### Module 4 – Design of Outdoor Lighting  
- Street lighting: illumination levels, fixtures, arrangements, lamp/luminaire selection, illumination level calculation.  
- Tunnel lighting: wattage, number, arrangement, spacing-to-mounting height ratio.  
- Flood lighting: fixtures, lamp/projector selection, aiming methods, wattage and arrangement calculations.  

### Module 5 – Special Features of Aesthetic Lighting  
- Monument and statue lighting, sports lighting, hospital and auditorium lighting.  
- Emergency lighting – general aspects.  
- Lighting controllers: dimmers, motion/occupancy sensors, photo sensors, timers.  
- Lighting system design using software (e.g., DIALux, Relux).
