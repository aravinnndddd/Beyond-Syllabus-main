# EET464: Computer Aided Power System Analysis  

## Course Objectives  
- Develop the model of power system networks.  
- Solve linear systems using computationally efficient methods.  
- Solve load flow problem to analyse the state of power systems.  
- Formulate optimal power flow problem in power system networks.  
- Analyse power system under short circuit conditions and infer the results to design a protective system.
