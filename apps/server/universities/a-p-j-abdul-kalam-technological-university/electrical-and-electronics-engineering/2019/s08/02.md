# EET414: Robotics  

## Course Objectives  
- Identify the anatomy and specifications of robots for typical applications.  
- Select the appropriate sensors and actuators for robots.  
- Identify robotic configurations and grippers for specific applications.  
- Solve forward and inverse kinematics of robotic manipulators.  
- Plan trajectories in joint space and Cartesian space.  
- Develop the dynamic model of a robotic manipulator and its control strategy.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction to Robotics  
- Definitions: Robots, Robotics.  
- Types: Manipulators, Mobile Robots (wheeled & legged), Aerial Robots.  
- Anatomy: Links, joints, actuators, sensors, controller.  
- Open vs closed kinematic chains, DOF.  
- Robot specifications – axes, work volume, speed, reach, repeatability, precision, control modes.  
- Applications: medical, mining, space, defence, domestic, industrial (material handling, welding, painting, machining).  
- **Case study:** Anatomy & specifications of a material-handling robot.  

### Module 2 – Sensors and Actuators  
- Sensor classification: Touch, force, proximity, vision.  
- Internal sensors: Position, velocity, acceleration, force.  
- External sensors: Contact and non-contact; vision sensor elements, image acquisition/processing.  
- Actuators: Electric (stepper, DC, servo, AC, linear), hydraulic, pneumatic – advantages/disadvantages, selection.  
- **Case study:** Sensors & actuators for a differential-drive autonomous robot and pick-and-place robot.  

### Module 3 – Robotic Configurations and End Effectors  
- Configurations: PPP, RPP, RRP, RRR; SCARA, PUMA robots.  
- Motion control methods & drive technologies.  
- 3R concurrent wrist.  
- End effectors: Mechanical, magnetic, vacuum, adhesive; active/passive grippers; selection factors.  
- **Case study:** Pick-and-place robot for objects on a moving conveyor.  

### Module 4 – Kinematics and Motion Planning  
- Robot coordinate systems, composite rotations, homogeneous transformations.  
- D-H parameters, direct kinematics, arm equation.  
- Forward & inverse kinematics (up to 3 DOF).  
- Motion planning: joint-space (cubic polynomial, linear + parabolic blend) and Cartesian-space planning.
