# EET476: Advanced Electronic Design  

## Course Objectives  
- Analyse the frequency response characteristics of op-amps along with their circuit properties.  
- Develop advanced op-amp circuits that serve as building blocks to more complex digital and analog circuits.  
- Design active filters as per situational and system demands.  
- Develop sensor circuits for physical quantity measurements.  
- Design the microcontroller interfacing with the analog domain for real-world applications.
