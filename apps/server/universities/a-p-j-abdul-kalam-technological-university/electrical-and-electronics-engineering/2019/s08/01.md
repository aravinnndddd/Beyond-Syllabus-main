# EET402: Electrical System Design and Estimation

## Course Objectives
- Explain the rules and regulations in the design of components for medium and high voltage installations.  
- Design lighting schemes for indoor and outdoor applications.  
- Design low/medium voltage domestic and industrial electrical installations.  
- Design, test, and commission an 11 kV transformer substation.  
- Design electrical installations in high-rise buildings.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – IS Product Standards, Electricity Act & NEC (6 hours)  
- Awareness of IS Codes: IS 732, IS 3043, IS 2026, IS 3646 (Part 1&2), IS 5216 (Part 1&2).  
- Electricity Supply Code 2014 – relevance to electrical installations.  
- The Electricity Act 2003 – overview of Part VI (Distribution), Part IX (CEA & Regulatory Commissions).  
- National Electric Code 2011 – Scope, Wiring Installation (Sec 9), Short Circuit Calculations (Sec 10).  
- Graphical symbols as per NEC.  
- Classification of voltages, standards, and tolerances for voltage & frequency.  

### Module 2 – Lighting Schemes & Calculations (6 hours)  
- Lighting design concepts: luminous flux, lumen, luminous intensity, illuminance (lux).  
- Factors affecting Coefficient of Utilisation (CoU) and Light Loss Factor (LLF).  
- Benefits and efficacy of LED lamps.  
- Average lumen method – space-to-mounting height ratio.  
- Design of lighting for seminar halls and outdoor lighting (point-to-point method).  
- Road and public area lighting – selection of luminaires (Metal Halide, HPSV, LPSV, LED).  

### Module 3 – Domestic Installation (10 hours)  
- NEC/IS 732 aspects for LV/MV dwellings (< 15 kW).
