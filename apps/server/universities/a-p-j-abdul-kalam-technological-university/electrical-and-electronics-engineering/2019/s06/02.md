# EET304: Power Systems II  

## Course Objectives  
* Apply the per-unit scheme for any power system network and compute fault levels.  
* Analyse the voltage profile of a power system network using iterative methods.  
* Analyse the steady-state and transient stability of power system networks.  
* Model the control schemes of power systems.  
* Perform optimal generation scheduling.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Per Unit System and Fault Analysis (10 Hours)  
* Per-unit quantities – single phase and three phase.  
* Symmetrical components – sequence networks.  
* Fault calculations – symmetrical & unsymmetrical faults.  
* Fault level of installations, limiters, contingency ranking.  

### Module 2 – Load Flow Studies (8 Hours)  
* Introduction to load flow studies and types.  
* Network model formulation and admittance matrix.  
* Gauss-Seidel method (two iterations).  
* Newton-Raphson method (qualitative analysis only).  
* Fast Decoupled method (two iterations).  
* Principle of DC load flow, introduction to distribution flow.  

### Module 3 – Power System Stability (10 Hours)  
* Steady-state, dynamic, and transient stability.  
* Power-angle curve and steady-state stability limit.  
* Mechanics of angular motion – swing equation.  
* Solution of swing equation – point-by-point method & RK method.  
* Equal area criterion – application & stability improvement methods.  
* Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) & Wide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS).  

### Module 4 – System Control (10 Hours)  
* Turbines, speed governors, inertia.  
* Automatic Generation Control – load frequency control in single-area and two-area systems.  
* Subsynchronous resonance.  
* Automatic voltage control – exciter control.  
* SCADA systems.  

### Module 5 – Economic Operation and Unit Commitment (8 Hours)  
* Economic load distribution within a plant.  
* Transmission loss as a function of plant generation.  
* Load distribution between plants.  
* Penalty factors and loss coefficients.  
* Unit commitment – constraints: spinning reserve, thermal & hydro unit constraints.
