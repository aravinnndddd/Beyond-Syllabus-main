# EET302: Linear Control Systems  

## Course Objectives  
* Describe the role of various control blocks and components in feedback systems.  
* Analyse the time-domain responses of linear systems.  
* Apply the root locus technique to assess the performance of linear systems.  
* Analyse the stability of LTI systems.  
* Analyse the frequency-domain response of LTI systems.  
* Design compensators using time and frequency domain techniques.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Feedback Control Systems (9 Hours)  
* Open-loop and closed-loop control systems – examples of automatic control systems.  
* Transfer function approach to feedback control systems – effect of feedback.  
* Control system components – DC & AC servo motors, tachogenerators, synchros, gyroscopes, stepper motors.  
* Controllers – types and compensators – transfer function and basic characteristics of lag, lead, and lag-lead compensators.  

### Module 2 – Performance Analysis of Control Systems (9 Hours)  
* Time-domain analysis – transient & steady-state responses, impulse & step responses of first and second-order systems.  
* Pole dominance in higher-order systems.  
* Error analysis – steady-state error, error constants, and dynamic error coefficients.  
* Stability analysis – BIBO and asymptotic stability, Routh’s criterion, relative stability.  

### Module 3 – Root Locus Analysis and Compensator Design (11 Hours)  
* Root locus construction and stability analysis.  
* Effect of adding poles and zeros; positive feedback effects.  
* Design of lag, lead, and lag-lead compensators using root locus.  
* PID controllers – Ziegler-Nichols tuning methods.  
* MATLAB/SCILAB-based root locus analysis (Demo/Assignment).  

### Module 4 – Frequency Domain Analysis (9 Hours)  
* Frequency-domain specifications and correlation with time-domain responses.  
* Polar plots – gain margin, phase margin, and stability analysis.  
* Bode plots – construction, stability analysis, effect of transportation lag, and non-minimum phase systems.  

### Module 5 – Nyquist Stability Criterion and Compensator Design (9 Hours)  
* Nyquist plots and stability analysis.  
* Introduction to Nichols chart (concepts only).
