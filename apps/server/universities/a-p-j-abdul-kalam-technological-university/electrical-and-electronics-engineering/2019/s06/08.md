# EET352: Object Oriented Programming  

## Course Objectives  
- Explain object-oriented programming concepts and creation of classes for Java applications.  
- Develop Java programs using arrays, strings, packages and inheritance concepts.  
- Build Java applications using abstract classes, interfaces, run-time errors and exceptions.  
- Develop Java applets and applications for file I/O operations.  
- Apply the concept of multithreading in Java applications.  

## Modules
