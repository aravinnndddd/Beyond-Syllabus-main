## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Three-Phase Alternators

- Principle of Operation, classification, construction, armature windings, winding factors, and EMF equation. Synchronous generator on load: armature reaction, synchronous impedance, equivalent circuit, and phasor diagram. Voltage regulation analysis using emf, mmf, and Potier methods based on OC and SC tests.

### Module 2: Synchronous Machine Operation

- Power flow equations in cylindrical-rotor generators. Parallel operation with infinite bus-bars, synchronisation methods, and the effect of changing mechanical input and excitation. V-curves and inverted V-curves. Salient-pole machines: two-reaction theory, slip test for determining Xd and Xq. Synchronous motors: principle, starting methods, power developed, power-angle characteristics, and efficiency.

### Module 3: Three-Phase Induction Motors

- Principle of operation, classification, construction, torque equation, and torque-slip characteristics. Analysis using phasor diagram and equivalent circuit. Power flow, losses, and efficiency. Performance evaluation from no-load and blocked-rotor tests and circle diagrams. Starting methods: DOL, autotransformer, star-delta, and rotor resistance starters.

### Module 4: Induction Machine Control & Single-Phase Motors

- Braking methods for induction motors: plugging, dynamic braking, and regenerative braking. Speed control techniques: stator voltage control, V/f control, and rotor resistance control. Induction generators (line-excited and self-excited). Single-phase induction motors: double revolving field theory, equivalent circuit, and types (split-phase, capacitor-start, permanent capacitor).
