## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Basic Computer Structure and Processing

-   Functional units, operational concepts, and bus structures. Memory locations, addresses, and operations. Instruction sequencing, addressing modes. Fundamental concepts of the basic processing unit, instruction cycle, and execution in single and multiple bus organizations.

### Module 2: Processor Logic and Design

-   Register transfer logic: arithmetic, logic, and shift micro-operations. Processor logic design: organization, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), status register, shifter, and accumulator design concepts.

### Module 3: Control Logic and Pipelining

-   Control Logic Design: Hardwired control and microprogrammed control (microinstructions, microprogram sequencing). Arithmetic algorithms: Signed-Operand multiplication (Booth Algorithm), and fast multiplication. Pipelining: basic principles, classification, and hazard detection/resolution.

### Module 4: Memory and I/O Organization

-   Memory systems: Types of memory, Virtual memory, Content Addressable Memory (CAM), and cache memories with mapping functions. I/O Organization: Data transfer schemes (Programmed I/O, Interrupt-controlled I/O), organization of interrupts (polling, daisy chaining), and Direct Memory Access (DMA).
