## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Number Systems and Logic Gates

-   Number Systems (binary, octal, hexadecimal) and codes (ASCII, Excess-3, Gray, BCD). Signed number representation and arithmetic using 1's and 2's complement. Basic and universal logic gates (TTL & CMOS). Boolean laws, Sum-of-Products, Product-of-Sums, and Karnaugh map simplification.

### Module 2: Combinational Logic Circuits

-   Design of combinational circuits including half/full adders, half/full subtractors, and parallel binary adders. Analysis of comparators, parity generators/checkers, encoders, decoders, and multiplexers/demultiplexers. Implementation of Boolean expressions using multiplexers.

### Module 3: Sequential Logic Circuits

-   Flip-Flops (SR, JK, D, T) with characteristic and excitation tables, including Master-Slave configuration. Design of asynchronous and synchronous counters (Up/Down, Modulo counters), Ring counters, and Johnson counters. Operation of various shift registers (SISO, SIPO, PISO, PIPO).

### Module 4: State Machines, Converters, and HDL

-   Introduction to State Machines (Moore and Mealy). Operation of Digital-to-Analog converters (weighted resistor, R-2R Ladder) and Analog-to-Digital converters (flash, successive approximation). Basic introduction to Verilog HDL for implementing simple logic circuits like adders.
