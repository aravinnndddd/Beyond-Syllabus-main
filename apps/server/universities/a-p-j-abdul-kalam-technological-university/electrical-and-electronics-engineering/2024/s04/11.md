# PEEET418 - Illumination Technology

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the principles of light, including electromagnetic radiation, human eye perception, and the properties of natural and artificial lighting.
2.  To develop the ability to measure and quantify light and apply these measurements to practical scenarios.
3.  To acquire the skills to design efficient and effective interior lighting systems.
4.  To learn to design and implement outdoor lighting solutions with a focus on energy efficiency and safety.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Light and Lighting

-   Introduction to light, the visible spectrum, and human eye perception. Day lighting vs. artificial lighting. Qualities of good lighting (glare, shadow, color rendering). Lighting schemes (direct, indirect, etc.). Working principles of various lamps (Incandescent, Halogen, Fluorescent, Vapour, LED).

### Module 2: Light Measurement

-   Definitions and units of light (luminous flux, illuminance, luminance). Laws of illumination (Inverse square law, Lambert’s cosine law). Polar curves and Rousseau’s construction. Measurement apparatus like Goniophotometers and luxmeters.

### Module 3: Interior Lighting Design

-   Design factors: maintenance factor, uniformity ratio, coefficient of utilization. Illumination requirements for various work planes. Selection of lamps and luminaires, calculation of wattage and number of lamps, and layout design. Special considerations for industrial, hospital, and emergency lighting.

### Module 4: Outdoor and Energy Efficient Lighting

-   Design of street lighting and floodlighting, including selection of lamps, fixtures, and arrangement. Special features for tunnel, aesthetic, and hazardous area lighting. Energy-efficient strategies and controls (dimmers, sensors, timers). Introduction to lighting design software (DIALux, Relux).
