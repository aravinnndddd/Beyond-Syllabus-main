## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Digital Image Fundamentals

-   Image representation, types of images, and elements of a DIP system. Basic relationships between pixels and distance measures. Color image fundamentals (RGB, CMY, HIS models), 2D sampling, and quantization.

### Module 2: Image Transforms and Compression

-   2D Image transforms including DFT, Walsh, Hadamard, Haar, DCT, and KL transform. Principles of image compression, lossless vs. lossy compression, transform coding, and the JPEG compression standard.

### Module 3: Image Enhancement

-   Spatial domain enhancement techniques: Gray Level Transformations, Histogram Processing, and Spatial Filtering (Smoothing, Sharpening). Frequency domain enhancement methods: low pass, high pass, and homomorphic filtering.

### Module 4: Image Restoration and Segmentation

-   Image degradation models and restoration techniques like Inverse filtering and Wiener Filtering. Image segmentation methods including region-based, clustering, thresholding, and edge-based approaches.
