# PEEET754 - Computer Vision

## Course Objectives

1.  To develop knowledge of various methods, algorithms, and applications of Computer Vision.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Image Processing and Shape Analysis

-   Review of image processing techniques. Mathematical morphology (Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing). Binary shape analysis, including connectedness, object labelling, and boundary descriptors like chain codes.

### Module 2: Feature Detection

-   Edge detection methods like Canny's algorithm and active contours. Corner detection using the Harris algorithm. Line and curve detection using the Hough transform.

### Module 3: 3D Vision and Motion Analysis

-   Recovering 3D shape from various cues (Shape from X), such as shading and texture. Motion analysis using Optical Flow (Horn-Shunck and Lucas-Kanade methods) and Structure from Motion.

### Module 4: Object Recognition and Applications

-   Object recognition techniques including shape matching, PCA, SVM, and Bayes rule. Specific applications like Eigenfaces for face detection and recognition. Real-time applications such as in-vehicle vision systems.
