## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Analysis of Sampled Data Systems

-   Review of Z-Transforms, Sampling Theorem, and Data Hold circuits. Pulse Transfer Function. Stability analysis in the z-plane using Jury's test and in the w-plane using Routh-Hurwitz.

### Module 2: Design of Digital Compensators

-   Design of Lag, Lead, and Lead-Lag compensators using root locus and frequency response methods. Realization of digital controllers.

### Module 3: Discrete-time State Space Analysis

-   State variable modeling of discrete systems. Relationship between state-space representation and pulse transfer function. Transformation to canonical forms and solution of state equations.

### Module 4: State Space Control Design

-   Discretization of continuous-time state-space equations. Concepts of Controllability and Observability. Design of state feedback controllers via Pole Placement and design of State Observers.
