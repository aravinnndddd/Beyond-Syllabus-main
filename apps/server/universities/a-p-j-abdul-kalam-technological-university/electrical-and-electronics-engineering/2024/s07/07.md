## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction and Phase Plane Analysis

-   Characteristics and state-space representation of nonlinear systems. Phase plane analysis, including singular points, stability, equilibrium points, and limit cycles using the isocline method.

### Module 2: Lyapunov Stability Theory

-   Stability analysis using Lyapunov's direct method and its associated theorems. Stability of linear systems using the Lyapunov equation and linearization (indirect) method.

### Module 3: Frequency Domain Analysis

-   Analysis of nonlinear systems using the describing function method for common nonlinearities (relay, dead zone, saturation). Stability analysis using the Circle Criterion.

### Module 4: Nonlinear Control Design

-   Introduction to feedback linearization (input-state and input-output). Design via linearization, including integral control and gain scheduling. Concepts of other nonlinear control techniques like sliding mode and backstepping.
