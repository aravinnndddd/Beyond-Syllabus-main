## Course Objectives

1.  To introduce the fundamental concepts of power quality, different power quality issues, and their mitigation methods.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Power Quality

-   Sources and effects of power quality problems. Types of disturbances: Transients, voltage variations (sag, swell), unbalance, and waveform distortion (harmonics, flicker). Power quality issues in grid-connected renewable energy systems.

### Module 2: Harmonics

-   Mechanism of harmonic generation, triplen harmonics, and common harmonic sources. Effects of harmonics on power system equipment. Harmonic analysis using Fourier series and transforms.

### Module 3: Power Quality Standards and Monitoring

-   Harmonic indices (THD, TDD), power factor, and an overview of power quality standards like IEEE 519 and IEC 61000. Objectives and instruments for power quality monitoring.

### Module 4: Mitigation Techniques

-   Mitigation of harmonics using passive and active filters. Correction of sag and swell using DVR. Power quality conditioners like DSTATCOM and UPQC. Power factor correction and solutions for wiring and grounding problems.
