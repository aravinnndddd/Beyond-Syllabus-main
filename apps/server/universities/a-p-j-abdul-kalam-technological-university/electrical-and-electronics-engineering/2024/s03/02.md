## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Network Theorems

- Mesh analysis and nodal analysis (Review only), super mesh and super node, Superposition principle, source transformation – analysis with DC and AC (sinusoidal) excitation  
- Thevenin’s theorem, Norton’s theorem, Maximum power transfer theorem – analysis with DC and AC (sinusoidal) excitation with independent and dependent sources  
- Reciprocity Theorem – application to the analysis of DC Circuits.

### Module 2: Resonance & 3-Phase Circuits

- Series resonance, resonant frequency, variations of impedance and current with frequency, bandwidth, quality factor  
- Parallel resonance (series RL in parallel with C – calculation of resonant frequency)  
- Power in 3-phase circuits – complex power, active, reactive and apparent power in balanced load  
- Steady-state analysis of 3-wire unbalanced delta connected circuit  
- Steady-state analysis of 3-phase 4-wire and 3-wire (using Millman’s theorem only) unbalanced star connected circuit – neutral shift

### Module 3: Transient Analysis using Laplace Transform

- Laplace transforms (Review only)  
- Transient response of simple series and parallel RL and RC circuits with DC excitation and initial conditions – natural response and forced response – time constant – solution using Laplace transforms – transformed circuits in s-domain – solution using mesh analysis and nodal analysis
