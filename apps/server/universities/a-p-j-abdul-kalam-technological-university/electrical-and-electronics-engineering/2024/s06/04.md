## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to OS and Processes

-   Operating system functions and boot process. Process management: states, PCB, threads, scheduling, and creation/termination. Inter-process communication via shared memory and message passing.

### Module 2: Process Scheduling and Synchronization

-   Scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin. Process synchronization concepts: race conditions, critical section problem, and solutions like Peterson's, Mutex Locks, Semaphores, and Monitors.

### Module 3: Deadlocks and Memory Management

-   Deadlock conditions, prevention, avoidance using Banker’s algorithm, detection, and recovery. Memory management techniques: swapping, contiguous allocation, segmentation, and paging. Introduction to virtual memory and page replacement algorithms.

### Module 4: File and Storage Management

-   File system concepts: attributes, operations, and structure. File system implementation, directory structures, and allocation methods. Storage management: magnetic disks, SSDs, disk structure, and disk scheduling algorithms.
