# PEEET631 - Digital Protection of Power Systems

## Course Objectives

1.  To deliver fundamental concepts for designing various electronic circuits to implement relaying functions.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Power System Protection

-   Need for protection, zones of protection, and instrument transformers (CTs/PTs). Principles of overcurrent, differential, and distance relays, including their characteristics.

### Module 2: Protection of Power System Apparatus

-   Protection schemes for transmission lines, bus-bars, transformers, generators, and motors. Includes differential protection, harmonic restraint, and restricted earth fault protection.

### Module 3: Digital (Numerical) Relays

-   Basic components, block diagram, and principle of operation of numerical relays. Comparison with older relay types. Signal conditioning, sampling, A/D conversion, and communication standards like IEC 61850.

### Module 4: Signal Processing and Wide Area Protection

-   Signal processing techniques and algorithms used in digital relays (Fourier, Least Squares). Fundamentals of digital filters (IIR/FIR). Introduction to Wide Area Protection, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), and adaptive relaying concepts.
