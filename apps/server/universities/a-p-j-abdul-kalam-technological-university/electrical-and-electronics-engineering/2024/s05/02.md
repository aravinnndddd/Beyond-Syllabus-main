## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Vector Calculus and Electrostatics

-   Vector analysis in different coordinate systems (Rectangular, Cylindrical, Spherical), Del operator, Gradient, Divergence, and Curl. Coulomb’s Law, Electric Field Intensity, Gauss’s Law, Electric Flux Density, and fields from various charge distributions.

### Module 2: Electrostatic Fields and Magnetostatics

-   Electric potential, relation between E and V, dipoles, energy density, conduction and convection currents, and boundary conditions. Magnetostatics: Biot-Savart’s Law, Ampere’s Circuital Law, and magnetic potentials.

### Module 3: Magnetostatics in Media and Maxwell's Equations

-   Magnetic forces, torque, magnetization in materials, magnetic boundary conditions, and inductance. Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, displacement current, and formulation of Maxwell-Heaviside equations.

### Module 4: Electromagnetic Waves and Transmission Lines

-   Wave propagation in lossy dielectrics, free space, and conductors (skin effect). Power flow and Poynting theorem. Reflection of plane waves. Transmission line equations, characteristic impedance, input impedance, and Standing Wave Ratio (SWR).
