## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Clocked Synchronous Sequential Networks

-   Analysis, modeling, state assignment, state reduction, and design of Clocked Synchronous Sequential Networks (CSSN).

### Module 2: Asynchronous Sequential Circuits

-   Algorithmic State Machine (ASM) charts and their realization. Analysis of Asynchronous Sequential Circuits (ASC), flow table reduction, races, and state assignment problems.

### Module 3: Hazards and Fault Detection

-   Identification of static and dynamic hazards. Design of hazard-free circuits. Practical issues like clock skew and jitter. Fault detection methods including fault table, path sensitization, and Boolean difference methods.

### Module 4: VHDL for Digital Design

-   Overview of the VLSI Design flow. Introduction to VHDL: data types, objects, and different modeling styles (Dataflow, Behavioural, Structural). Writing VHDL code for combinational and sequential circuits.
