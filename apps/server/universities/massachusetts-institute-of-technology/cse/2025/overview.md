# MIT Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) - 2025

## Overview

MIT's Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering) is a comprehensive undergraduate program that combines theoretical foundations with practical skills in computer science. This major covers algorithms and theory, software engineering, programming languages, computer systems, human-computer interaction, graphics, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The program follows MIT's distinctive approach to technical education, emphasizing both depth and breadth. Students complete the General Institute Requirements (GIRs) alongside specialized coursework that progresses from fundamental programming concepts to advanced topics in computer science.

## Subject Numbering Notes

As of 2022, MIT EECS has undergone significant curriculum restructuring with new subject numbering:
- 6.100A/L replaces 6.0001
- 6.1010 consolidates multiple programming subjects
- 6.1200[J] is cross-listed with 18.062[J]
- Many subjects have been renumbered in the 6.1xxx series

## Course Tracks

Students can specialize through various tracks including:
- **Computer Science tracks**: Systems, Theory, AI/ML, Programming Languages, Graphics/HCI
- **AI + Decision Making tracks**: Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing
- **Electrical Engineering tracks**: Circuits, Signal Processing, Communications
