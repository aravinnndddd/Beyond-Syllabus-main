# CET303: Design of Concrete Structures

## Course Objectives

- Recall the fundamental concepts of limit state design and code provisions for design of concrete members under bending, shear, compression and torsion  
- Analyse reinforced concrete sections to determine the ultimate capacity in bending, shear and compression  
- Design and detail beams, slabs, stairs and footings using IS code provisions  
- Design and detail columns using IS code and SP 16 design charts  
- Explain the criteria for earthquake resistant design of structures and ductile detailing of concrete structures subjected to seismic forces
