# CET305: Geotechnical Engineering - II

## Course Objectives

- Understand soil exploration methods  
- Explain the basic concepts, theories, and methods of analysis in foundation engineering  
- Calculate bearing capacity, pile capacity, foundation settlement and earth pressure  
- Analyze shallow and deep foundations  
- Solve the field problems related to geotechnical engineering  

## Course Content

### Module I

- Earth pressure – At rest, active, and passive  
- Rankine’s theory for cohesionless and cohesive soils – point of application, surcharge, water table influence  
- Earth pressure with layered backfill  
- Coulomb’s theory (no derivation) – Comparison with Rankine’s theory  
- Foundation types: shallow and deep  
- Selection of foundation type and overview of shallow foundations  

### Module II

- Bearing capacity of shallow foundations: gross vs net bearing pressure  
- Ultimate vs safe bearing capacity – Terzaghi’s theory (strip, circular, and square footings – no derivation)  
- Assumptions, bearing capacity factors, effect of water table  
- General, local, and punching shear failure  
- Skempton’s formula  

### Module III

- Settlement: causes and estimation of immediate settlement
