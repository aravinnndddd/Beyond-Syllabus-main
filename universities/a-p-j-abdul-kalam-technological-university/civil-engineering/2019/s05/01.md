# CET301: Structural Analysis - I

## Course Objectives

- Apply the principles of solid mechanics to analyse trusses  
- Apply various methods to determine deflections in statically determinate structures  
- Identify the problems with static indeterminacy and tackle such problems by means of the method of consistent deformations and energy principles  
- Apply specific methods such as slope deflection and moment distribution methods of structural analysis for typical structures with different characteristics  
- Apply suitable methods of analysis for various types of structures including cables, suspension bridges, and arches  
- Analyse the effects of moving loads on structures using influence lines
