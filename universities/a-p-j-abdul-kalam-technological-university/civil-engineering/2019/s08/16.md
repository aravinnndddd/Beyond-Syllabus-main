# CET418: Earthquake Resistant Design

## Course Objectives

- Formulate appropriate SDOF models of simple structural systems under dynamic loads and apply them to engineering problems  
- Analyze and interpret the dynamic response of SDOF systems for various dynamic inputs  
- Develop mathematical models for 2 DOF systems and MDOF shear building models, and estimate their natural frequencies and vibration modes  
- Explain the basics of engineering seismology, ground motion characteristics, structural behavior during earthquakes, and seismic design philosophy  
- Apply Indian seismic design standards to estimate seismic demand on structures
