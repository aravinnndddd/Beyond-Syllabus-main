# CET456: Repair and Rehabilitation of Buildings

## Course Objectives

- Recall the basic ideas and theories associated with concrete technology and masonry structures.  
- Understand the need and methodology of repair and rehabilitation of structures, mechanisms used, and tools for diagnosis.  
- Identify criteria for repair/maintenance and types/properties of materials used for repairing damaged and corroded structures.  
- Propose holistic solutions for maintenance or rehabilitation and apply methodologies for repairing or demolishing structures.  
- Analyse and assess structural damage using various tests.
