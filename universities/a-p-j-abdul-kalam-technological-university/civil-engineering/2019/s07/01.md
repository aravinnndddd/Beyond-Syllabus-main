# CET401: Design of Steel Structures

## Course Objectives

- Explain the behavior and properties of structural steel members to resist various structural forces and actions, and apply the relevant codes of practice.  
- Analyse the behavior of structural steel members and undertake design at both serviceability and ultimate limit states.  
- Explain the theoretical and practical aspects of design of composite steel structures along with planning and design aspects.  
- Apply diverse knowledge of steel design engineering practices to real-life problems.  
- Demonstrate experience in implementing steel structure designs using engineering concepts in structural engineering.
