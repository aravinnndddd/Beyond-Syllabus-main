# CET201: Mechanics of Solids

## Course Objectives

* Recall the fundamental terms and theorems associated with mechanics of linear elastic deformable bodies. (Cognitive Level: Remembering)  
* Explain the behavior and response of various structural elements under various loading conditions. (Cognitive Level: Understanding)  
* Apply the principles of solid mechanics to calculate internal stresses/strains, stress resultants and strain energies in structural elements subjected to axial/transverse loads and bending/twisting moments. (Cognitive Level: Applying)  
* Choose appropriate principles or formula to find the elastic constants of materials making use of the information available. (Cognitive Level: Applying)  
* Perform stress transformations, identify principal planes/stresses and maximum shear stress at a point in a structural member. (Cognitive Level: Applying)  
* Analyse the given structural member to calculate the safe load or proportion the cross section to carry the load safely. (Cognitive Level: Analysing)
