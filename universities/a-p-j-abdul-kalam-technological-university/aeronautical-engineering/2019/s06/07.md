# AOT342: Design of Aerospace Structures

## Course Objectives

- Understand the different phases of aircraft design and carry out preliminary design including maximum take-off weight estimation.
- Design a wing structure by selecting appropriate airfoil with suitable taper ratio and twist.
- Design a propulsion system.
- Design a landing gear structure and subsystems.
- Understand the effect of temperature on the properties of materials used for re-entry vehicles.

## Course Content

### Module 1
- Introduction to design  
- Phases of aircraft design: conceptual, preliminary, and detail design  
- Maximum take-off weight estimation: weight build-up, payload weight, crew weight, fuel weight, empty weight  
- Wing area and sizing

### Module 2
- General features of an airfoil  
- Characteristic graphs of an airfoil  
- Airfoil selection criteria  
- NACA airfoils: four, five, and 6-series  
- Aspect ratio and its effect on Cl vs angle of attack  
- Taper ratio and its effect on lift distribution  
- Twist angles: geometric twist and aerodynamic twist  
- Lifting-line theory

### Module 3
- Aircraft engine classification: piston-prop, turbojet, turbofan, turboprop, turboshaft, rocket engine  
- Selection of engine type: absolute ceiling and flight Mach number, propulsive efficiency, specific fuel consumption, engine weight, passenger appeal, noise & vibration, engine maintainability, engine size  
- Engine location: general guidelines  
- Twin-jet engine: under-wing versus rear fuselage  
- Propeller sizing *(including numerical problems)*

### Module 4
- Landing gear configuration  
- Landing gear height: general ground clearance requirement, take-off rotation clearance  
- Wheel base, wheel track, overturn angle requirements, structural integrity  
- Tip back and tip forward angle requirements *(including numerical problems)*  
- Landing gear subsystems: tire sizing, shock absorber, strut sizing, landing gear retraction system

### Module 5
- High temperature materials: iron-base, nickel-base, cobalt-base superalloys and their properties  
- Factors influencing functional life of components at elevated temperature  
- Definition of creep curve and stages of creep  
- Metallurgical factors influencing creep stages  
- Effect of stress, temperature, and strain rate
