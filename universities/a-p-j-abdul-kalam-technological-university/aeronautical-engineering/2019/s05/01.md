# AOT301: Aircraft Structures II

## Course Objectives

- Analyze bending stress in symmetrical & unsymmetrical sections.
- Analyze the shear flow in open section beams and torsion of non-circular prismatic beams.
- Analyze the shear flow in closed section beams.
- Analyze the buckling behavior of plates, columns under various loads.
- Analyze the aircraft wing and fuselage.

## Course Content

### Module 1
