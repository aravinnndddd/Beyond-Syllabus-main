# MAT202: Probability, Statistics and Numerical Methods

## Course Objectives

- Understand the concept, properties and important models of discrete random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena.
- Understand the concept, properties and important models of continuous random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena.
- Perform statistical inferences concerning characteristics of a population based on attributes of samples drawn from the population.
- Compute roots of equations, evaluate definite integrals and perform interpolation on given numerical data using standard numerical techniques.
- Apply standard numerical techniques for solving systems of equations, fitting curves on given numerical data and solving ordinary differential equations.

## Course Content

### Module 1: Discrete Probability Distributions

- Discrete random variables and their probability distributions
- Expectation, mean and variance
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution
- Discrete bivariate distributions, marginal distributions

### Module 2: Continuous Probability Distributions

- Continuous random variables and their probability distributions
- Expectation, mean and variance

### Module 3: Statistical Inference

- Population and samples
- Sampling distribution of the mean and proportion (for large samples only)
- Confidence interval for single mean and single proportion (for large samples only)
- Hypothesis testing:
