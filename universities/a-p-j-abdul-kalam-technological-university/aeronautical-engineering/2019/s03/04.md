# AOT205: Mechanics of Flight and Aircraft Basics

## Course Objectives

- Explain structure of the atmosphere and basic concepts of airfoil  
- Explain aircraft structures and aircraft propulsion systems  
- Derive and discuss about the drag, power and thrust characteristics  
- Analyse the performance of aircraft under various flight conditions such as take-off, cruise, landing, climbing, gliding, turning and other manoeuvres  
- Evaluate static and dynamic response of aircraft for both voluntary and involuntary changes in flight conditions
