# AOT401: Computational Aerodynamics

## Course Objectives

- Attain familiarity with fundamental laws and the formulation of the governing equations of fluid mechanics and their mathematical nature in different flow regimes; simplifications of the Navier-Stokes equations to Euler’s and potential flow equations.
- Apply finite difference methods to various types of flow equations and solve the resulting set of algebraic equations; understand the concepts of stability and convergence of numerical solutions.
- Apply numerical methods for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using Primitive Variable and Vorticity-Stream Function formulations.
- Apply finite volume methods for Navier-Stokes equations on different types of grids, and time integration methods for solving flow equations.
- Understand the steps involved in obtaining numerical solutions for flow problems and use commercially available software for simulation, verification, and validation of results.
