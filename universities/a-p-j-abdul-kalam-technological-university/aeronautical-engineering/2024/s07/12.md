# PEAOT754 - Elastic Analysis of Plates and Shells

## Course Objectives

1.  To introduce the fundamental principles of **elasticity** and their application to the analysis of **plates and shells**.
2.  To analyze the behavior of plates and shells under various loading conditions, including **bending, buckling, and vibration**.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Elasticity and Plate Theory

-   Fundamentals of **elasticity**: stress, strain, material behaviour, and Hooke's law.
-   **Plate Theory Basics**: Kirchhoff-Love vs. Mindlin-Reissner theories and governing differential equations.
-   Analytical methods for solving plate problems, such as **Navier's solution**.

### Module 2: Advanced Plate Analysis

-   **Buckling of plates**: Theory and calculation of critical loads for various boundary conditions.
-   **Dynamic analysis of plates**: Natural frequencies, mode shapes, and free/forced vibration analysis.
-   Analysis of plates with complex boundary conditions and cutouts.

### Module 3: Shell Theory and Analysis

-   Fundamentals of **Shell Theory** for different shell types (cylindrical, spherical, conical).
-   **Membrane theory vs. bending theory**.
-   Analysis of thin shells, including stress and strain in pressure vessels and structural shells.

### Module 4: Applications and Case Studies

-   **Case studies in plate analysis** for real-world applications like bridges, aircraft wings, and building floors.
-   **Case studies in shell analysis** for structures like domes, pressure vessels, and tanks.
-   Practical considerations, including material properties and environmental effects.
