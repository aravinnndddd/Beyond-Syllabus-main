## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Composite Materials

-   **Definition and classification** of composites (polymer matrix, metal matrix, ceramic matrix).
-   Overview of **constituent materials** (fibers like glass/carbon, and matrices).
-   Introduction to fabrication methods like **hand lay-up, resin transfer molding, and filament winding**.

### Module 2: Mechanics of Composite Materials

-   **Stress-strain relationships** and Hooke’s law for anisotropic materials.
-   **Micromechanics** (analysis of a single layer) and **Macromechanics** (behavior of laminates).
-   Introduction to common **failure theories** (Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu).

### Module 3: Design of Composite Structures

-   Design principles for composite structures, including **weight optimization**.
-   Basics of **Classical Laminate Theory (CLT)** for stress-strain analysis.
-   Introduction to **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** in composite design.

### Module 4: Fabrication and Testing

-   Detailed exploration of composite **manufacturing processes**.
-   **Quality control** using **non-destructive testing (NDT)** methods.
-   **Mechanical testing procedures** (tensile, compression, shear tests) for composite materials.
