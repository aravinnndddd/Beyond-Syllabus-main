# PEAOT742 - Cryogenics

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand **cryogenic temperatures**, the behaviour of materials under extreme cold conditions, and the **thermodynamic principles** that govern cryogenic systems.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Cryogenic Systems

-   **Historical development and applications** of cryogenics in space, medicine, and industry.
-   **Low-temperature properties** of engineering materials (mechanical, thermal, electrical).
-   Properties of **cryogenic fluids** like liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

### Module 2: Gas Liquefaction Systems

-   **Thermodynamically ideal systems** and the **Joule-Thomson effect**.
-   Various liquefaction cycles such as **Linde-Hampson, Claude, and Cascade systems**.
-   Specific liquefaction systems for **Neon, Hydrogen, and Helium**.

### Module 3: Cryogenic Refrigeration Systems

-   **Ideal refrigeration systems** and **Joule-Thomson refrigeration**.
-   Study of **Philips, Solvay, and Gifford refrigerators**.
-   Introduction to **pulse tube refrigerators** and **magnetic cooling**.

### Module 4: Cryogenic Storage, Transfer, and Instrumentation

-   Design of **cryogenic storage vessels** and transportation systems.
-   **Thermal insulation** techniques, including super insulations and vacuum insulation.
-   **Cryogenic instrumentation** for measuring pressure, flow rate, liquid level, and temperature.
