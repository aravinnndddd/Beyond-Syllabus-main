# PBAOT504 - Heat Transfer

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the **fundamentals of heat transfer** as they relate to the design of engineering systems and devices.
2.  To cover the **mathematical formulations** and real-world applications of **conduction, convection, and radiation**.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Conduction Heat Transfer

-   Basic modes of heat transfer and **Fourier’s law**.
-   **One-dimensional steady-state heat conduction** in composite mediums and extended surfaces (fins).
-   **One-dimensional transient heat conduction** analysis using lumped mass analysis and Heisler's charts.

### Module 2: Convection Heat Transfer

-   **Free and forced convection** and associated non-dimensional parameters (Nusselt, Prandtl, Grashof).
-   **Laminar and turbulent convective heat transfer** analysis using boundary layer concepts in flows over flat plates and in pipes.

### Module 3: Radiation and Heat Exchangers

-   Physical mechanism of **radiation heat transfer** and radiation laws (Planck’s, Wein’s, Kirchoff’s, Stefan-Boltzmann).
-   Calculation of **radiation shape factors** and heat exchange between non-black bodies.
-   Design of **heat exchangers** using the **LMTD** and **ε-NTU** methods.

### Module 4: Spacecraft Thermal Control

-   The need for **spacecraft thermal control** and energy balance.
-   **Passive thermal control** devices (heat sinks, heat pipes, insulation).
-   **Active thermal control** techniques (heaters, fluid systems) and **ablative heat transfer**.
