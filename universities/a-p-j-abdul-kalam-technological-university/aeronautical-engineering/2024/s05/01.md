## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Compressible Flow and Normal Shocks

-   Introduction to **one-dimensional compressible flow** using continuity, momentum, and energy equations.
-   Flow through **convergent-divergent passages** and performance under various back pressures.
-   Analysis of **normal shock relations**, Prandtl’s relation, and moving normal shocks.

### Module 2: Oblique Shocks and Expansion Waves

-   Analysis of **oblique shock relations**, shock polar, and the reflection/intersection of shocks.
-   **Prandtl-Meyer expansion** waves and calculation of maximum turning angle.
-   Introduction to **Fanno flow** and **Rayleigh flow**.

### Module 3: Equations of Motion for Compressible Flow

-   **Small perturbation potential theory** and the method of characteristics for supersonic flows.
-   Application of the **Prandtl-Glauert rule** for subsonic flows.
-   **Linearized two-dimensional supersonic flow theory** to determine lift, drag, and pitching moment.

### Module 4: Transonic and Supersonic Aerodynamics

-   **Transonic flow** phenomena including critical Mach number, drag divergence, and shock stall.
-   Design considerations for **supersonic airfoils and wings**, including the **transonic area rule** and swept wings.
