## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Composite Materials

-   **Characteristics and classification** of composites (fibre-reinforced, particle-reinforced).
-   Study of constituent materials: **fibers** (glass, carbon, aramid) and **matrix materials** (thermosetting, thermoplastic).
-   The role of the **interface and interphase** in composite performance.

### Module 2: Manufacturing of Composite Materials

-   Production methods for various **fibers**.
-   **Fabrication techniques** for thermosetting and thermoplastic resin matrix composites.
-   Manufacturing of **Metal Matrix Composites (MMC)** and **Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC)**.

### Module 3: Testing and Characterization

-   **Mechanical testing** of composites, including uniaxial tension, compression, and shear tests.
-   **Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE)** techniques such as ultrasonic testing, acoustic emission, and X-radiography.
-   Analysis of **mechanical behaviour** and **failure modes** in composite structures.

### Module 4: Design and Analysis of Composite Structures

-   Analysis of **laminated composite structures**, including symmetric, cross-ply, and angle-ply laminates.
-   **Design considerations** for composite structures in aerospace applications.
-   **Advancements in composites**, such as carbon-carbon composites, nano-composites, and smart composites.
