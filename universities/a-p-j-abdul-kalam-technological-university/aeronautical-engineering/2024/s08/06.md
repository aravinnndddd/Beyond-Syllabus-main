# PEAOT866 - Design of Aerospace Structures

## Course Objectives

-   To understand general **design concepts** for aerospace structures, components, vehicles, and materials.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Aerospace Structures

-   **Semi-Monocoque** aerospace structures, including loads and design considerations.
-   **Bending, shear, and torsion** of open, closed, and thin-walled beams.
-   Torsion on single-cell and multiple-cell thin-walled beams.

### Module 2: Buckling of Thin-Walled Beams

-   Concept of **structural instability** and **flexural buckling** analysis.
-   **Pure torsional buckling** and coupled flexural-torsional buckling of open thin-walled beams.
-   **Buckling and post-buckling** of stiffened skin panels.

### Module 3: Plate Theory

-   Two-dimensional and three-dimensional **transformation of stresses and strains**.
-   **Thin Plate Theory**, including stress resultants and kinematics.
-   Thin plate **governing equations** and boundary conditions.

### Module 4: Composite and Sandwich Structures

-   Introduction to **advanced fibre composites** and analysis of orthotropic composite plies.
-   **Laminate theory**, including stiffness matrix, stress, strain, and thermal expansion.
-   **Failure mechanisms and criteria** for composites, and an introduction to **sandwich structures**.
