## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamentals of Celestial Mechanics

-   **Reference frames and coordinate systems**, the celestial sphere, and time systems.
-   **Kepler's laws**, Newton's law of gravitation, and estimation of orbital and escape velocity.
-   The **many-body problem**, including the circular restricted three-body problem and **Lagrange points**.

### Module 2: Orbit Determination

-   The **two-body problem** and the relation between a satellite's position and time.
-   **Coordinate transformations** between geocentric equatorial and perifocal frames.
-   **Orbit determination** from position vectors using the **Gibbs method** and **Gauss’s method**.

### Module 3: Orbital Maneuvers

-   Analysis of **orbital maneuvers**, including the **Hohmann Transfer** and non-Hohmann transfers.
-   **Interplanetary trajectories**, the sphere of influence, and the **method of patched conics**.

### Module 4: Rocket Dynamics

-   **Stage separation dynamics** and separation techniques for multi-stage rockets.
-   **Aerodynamic jet control** methods for rocket vehicles.
-   Analysis of rocket performance at various altitudes and rocket dispersion.
