# OEAOT836 - Advanced Heat Transfer

## Course Objectives

-   To provide knowledge of the **fundamentals and advanced concepts** of the various heat transfer modes and mechanisms.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Conduction Heat Transfer

-   Basic modes of heat transfer and **Fourier’s law**.
-   **One-dimensional steady-state conduction** in composite mediums and extended surfaces (fins).
-   **One-dimensional transient heat conduction** analysis using lumped mass analysis and Heisler's charts.

### Module 2: Convection Heat Transfer

-   **Free and forced convection** and associated non-dimensional parameters (Nusselt, Prandtl, Grashof).
-   **Laminar and turbulent convective heat transfer** analysis using boundary layer concepts in flows over flat plates and in pipes.
-   Introduction to numerical techniques for solving heat transfer problems.

### Module 3: Radiation and Heat Exchangers

-   Physical mechanism of **radiation heat transfer** and radiation laws (Planck’s, Wein’s, Kirchoff’s, Stefan-Boltzmann).
-   Formulation of **radiation shape factors** and heat exchange between non-black bodies.
-   Design of **heat exchangers** using the **LMTD** and **ε-NTU** methods.

### Module 4: Phase Change Heat Transfer and Advanced Radiation

-   **Condensation** heat transfer, including laminar/turbulent film and drop condensation.
-   **Boiling** heat transfer, including pool boiling regimes and flow boiling.
-   **Radiation heat transfer** in a participating medium and its effect on temperature measurements.
