## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the fundamental sources of **failure in mechanical components**.
2.  To understand **fatigue design curve approaches** and their limitations.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fatigue of Structures

-   Introduction to **S-N curves**, **endurance limits**, and the effect of mean stress using **Goodman, Gerber, and Soderberg relations**.
-   Analysis of notches and **stress concentrations**, including Neuber’s factors.
-   Introduction to the fatigue of composite materials.

### Module 2: Physical and Statistical Aspects of Fatigue

-   Phases in fatigue life: **crack initiation, crack growth, and final fracture**.
-   **Low cycle vs. high cycle fatigue** (Coffin-Manson relation).
-   Cycle counting techniques and **cumulative damage analysis** using **Miner’s theory**.

### Module 3: Fracture Mechanics

-   Strength of cracked bodies based on **Griffith’s theory**.
-   **Irwin-Orwin extension** of Griffith’s theory to ductile materials.
-   **Stress intensity factors** for typical geometries and the importance of fracture mechanics in aerospace structures.

### Module 4: Fatigue Design and Testing

-   **Safe life** and **Fail-safe** design philosophies.
-   **Crack arrest** and repair methodologies.
-   Introduction to **fracture toughness testing** and **Failure Assessment Diagrams**.
