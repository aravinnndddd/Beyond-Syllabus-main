## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Fundamental Concepts

-   **Euler's equation** and the **Incompressible Bernoulli’s equation**.
-   Concepts of **Circulation, Vortices, Stream function, and Potential function**.
-   **Elementary flows** and their combinations, and ideal flow over a cylinder (**D’Alembert’s paradox**, **Magnus effect**).

### Module 2: Airfoil and Wing Theory

-   **Thin airfoil theory** and its applications.
-   **Vortex filament**, Biot-Savart law, bound and trailing vortex, and **Lifting line theory**.
-   Types of airspeed, various forms of **drag**, and the **drag polar curve**.

### Module 3: Aircraft Performance

-   **Straight and level flight**, including thrust and power required vs. available.
-   **Gliding, climbing flight, range, and endurance** calculations.
-   **Take-off, landing, and turning performance**.

### Module 4: Viscous Flow and Propeller Theory

-   The **boundary layer** and its various thickness definitions (displacement, momentum, energy).
-   **Boundary layer equations** for steady, two-dimensional incompressible flow.
-   Introduction to **propeller theory** and the basics of **turbulent flow**.
