# PCAOT601 - Rocketry and Rocket Propulsion

## Course Objectives

1.  To understand the working of different types of **rocket engines** used for space transportation.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Principles of Rocket Motion

-   Derivation of the **thrust equation** and analysis of one and two-dimensional rocket motion.
-   Determination of **trajectories**, range, and altitude.
-   The need for **multi-staging** and vehicle optimization.

### Module 2: Rocket Vehicle Dynamics

-   **Stage separation** dynamics and separation techniques.
-   **Aerodynamic jet control** methods.
-   **Drag estimation** for rocket vehicles, including wave, skin friction, form, and base pressure drag.

### Module 3: Chemical Rocket Engines

-   **Solid propellant** rocket motors, including propellant properties, combustion, and instabilities.
-   **Liquid propellant** rocket engines, including different propellants, feed systems (pressure and turbo pump), ignition, and cooling.

### Module 4: Advanced Propulsion Systems

-   **Hybrid rocket engines** and their limitations.
-   Introduction to non-air breathing systems like **nuclear rockets, electric propulsion** (electrothermal, electrostatic), **solar thermal rockets**, and **solar sails**.
