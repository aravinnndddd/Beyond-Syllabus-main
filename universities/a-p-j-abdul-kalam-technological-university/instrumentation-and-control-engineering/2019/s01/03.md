# EST110: Engineering Graphics

## Course Objectives
* To introduce students to the fundamentals of technical drawing as a communication tool in engineering.  
* To enable students to visualize and represent three-dimensional objects through orthographic, isometric, and perspective projections.  
* To develop the ability to draw sectional views, surface developments, and multiview projections.  
* To provide exposure to modern computer-aided design (CAD) tools for solid modeling and projections.  

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Draw the projection of points and lines located in different quadrants. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*  
* **CO 2:** Prepare multiview orthographic projections of objects by visualizing them in different positions. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*  
* **CO 3:** Draw sectional views and develop surfaces of a given object. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*  
* **CO 4:** Prepare pictorial drawings using the principles of isometric and perspective projections to visualize objects in three dimensions. *(Cognitive level: Apply)*  
* **CO 5:** Convert 3D views to orthographic views. *(Cognitive level: Analyze)*  
* **CO 6:** Obtain multiview projections and solid models of objects using CAD tools. *(Cognitive level: Apply & Analyze)*  

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Projection of Points and Lines)
* Introduction: relevance of technical drawing in engineering field.  
* Types of lines, dimensioning, BIS code of practice for technical drawing.  
* Orthographic projection of points in different quadrants.  
* Projection of straight lines inclined to one plane and inclined to both planes.  
* Trace of a line. Inclination of lines with reference planes.  
* True length of line inclined to both the reference planes.  

### Module - 2 (Projection of Solids)
* Projection of simple solids such as triangular, rectangular, square, pentagonal and hexagonal prisms, pyramids, cone and cylinder.  
* Projection of solids in simple position including profile view.  
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to one of the reference planes.  
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to both reference planes.  

### Module - 3 (Sections and Development of Surfaces)
* Sections of prisms, pyramids, cone, cylinder with axis in vertical position and cut by different section planes.  
* True shape of the sections. Locating the section plane when the true shape is given.  
* Development of surfaces of the above solids and solids cut by different section planes.  
* Finding the shortest distance between two points on the surface.  

### Module - 4 (Isometric Projection)
