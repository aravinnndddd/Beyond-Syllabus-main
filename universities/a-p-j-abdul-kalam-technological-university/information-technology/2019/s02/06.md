# EST110: Engineering Graphics

## Course Outcomes

- Draw the projection of points and lines located in different quadrants.  
- Prepare multiview orthographic projections of objects by visualizing them in different positions.  
- Draw sectional views and develop surfaces of a given object.  
- Prepare pictorial drawings using the principles of isometric and perspective projections to visualize objects in three dimensions.  
- Convert 3D views to orthographic views.  
- Obtain multiview projections and solid models of objects using CAD tools.
