# CYL120 - Engineering Chemistry Lab

## Course Outcomes

- Understand and practice different techniques of quantitative chemical analysis to generate experimental skills and apply these skills to various analyses  
- Develop skills relevant to synthesize organic polymers and acquire the practical skill to use TLC for the identification of drugs  
- Develop the ability to understand and explain the use of modern spectroscopic techniques for analysing and interpreting the IR spectra and NMR spectra of some organic compounds  
- Acquire the ability to understand, explain and use instrumental techniques for chemical analysis  
- Learn to design and carry out scientific experiments as well as accurately record and analyze the results of such experiments  
- Function as a member of a team, communicate effectively and engage in further learning. Also understand how chemistry addresses social, economic, and environmental problems and why it is an integral part of curriculum
