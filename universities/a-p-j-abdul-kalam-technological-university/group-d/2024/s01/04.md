## SYLLABUS  

### Module 1 (Introduction & Projection of Points and Lines)  
* Relevance of technical drawing in engineering field.  
* Types of lines.  
* Dimensioning.  
* BIS code of practice for technical drawing. *(No questions for the end semester examination)*  
* Projection of points in different quadrants.  
* Projection of straight lines inclined to one plane and inclined to both planes.  
* Trace of a line.  
* Inclination of lines with reference planes.  
* True length and true inclinations of line inclined to both the reference planes.  

### Module 2 (Projection of Solids)  
* Projection of simple solids â€“ Triangular, Rectangle, Square, Pentagonal and Hexagonal Prisms, Pyramids, Cone and Cylinder.  
* Projection of solids in simple position including profile view.  
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to one of the reference planes.  
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to both reference planes.  

### Module 3 (Sections of Solids & Development of Surfaces)  
* Sections of Prisms, Pyramids, Cone and Cylinder with axis in vertical position and cut by different section planes.  
* True shape of the sections. *(Exclude true shape given problems)*  
* Development of surfaces of solids.  
* Development of solids cut by different section planes. *(Exclude problems with through holes)*  

### Module 4 (Isometric Projection & Computer Aided Drawing)  
* Isometric scale, Isometric view and projections of Prisms, Pyramids, Cone, Cylinder, Sphere, Hemisphere and their combinations.  
* Computer Aided Drawing (CAD): Introduction and role of CAD in design and development of new products.  
* Advantages of CAD.  
* Creating two-dimensional drawings with dimensions using suitable software. *(CAD, only internal evaluation)*
