## SEMESTER S1
# INTRODUCTION TO FOOD TECHNOLOGY
**Course Code:** GDFTT104  

## Course Objectives
1. To study the different types of food groups and categories of food.  
2. To acquire knowledge on basic engineering properties of food.  
3. To understand mechanics of fluids and basic process calculations.  

## SYLLABUS  

### Module 1 (Food & Nutrients)  
* Introduction to food and nutrients.  
* Definition and functions of food.  
* Food groups.  
* Nutrients in food – Carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals: classification, functions, and sources.  
* Role of water as a nutrient and its dietary sources.  

### Module 2 (Engineering Properties of Foods)  
* Shape and size – criteria and methods of measurement.  
* Volume – methods of measurement.  
* Density – types and measurement: apparent, material, particle, bulk, true density.  
* Laws of friction – effects of load and properties of contacting bodies, sliding velocity, contact surface temperature, water film, and surface roughness.  
* Rolling resistance, angle of repose, angle of internal friction.  
* Viscosity and its measurement.  
* Firmness and hardness – mechanics of hardness, dynamic hardness.  
* Effect of age, water content, and temperature on food texture.  

### Module 3 (Fluid Mechanics)  
* Definition and properties of fluids – density, specific gravity, compressibility, surface tension, viscosity.  
* Absolute and kinematic viscosity, variation of properties with temperature and pressure.  
* Rheology of fluids – Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.  
* Fluid statics – Pascal’s law, hydrostatic equilibrium in gravity and centrifugal field, barometric equation.  
* Manometers – principle and applications.  
* Continuous gravity and centrifugal decanters.  
* Fluid kinematics – Introduction, Reynolds experiment, classification of flow.  
* Equation of Continuity (without derivation).  
* Bernoulli’s Equation – derivation and applications.  

### Module 4 (Basics of Process Calculations)  
* Units and dimensions – basic and derived quantities.  
* Unit conversion and empirical equation conversion.  
* Moisture content – wet basis and dry basis.  
* Mole concept – methods of expressing composition: mole fraction, weight fraction, volume fraction.  
* Concentration of liquid solutions – molarity, molality, normality, ppm.  
* Order of reaction – definition.  
* Limiting and excess reactants.  
* Conversion, yield, and selectivity.  
* Energy balance:  
  - Heat capacity, mean heat capacity, Kopp's rule.  
  - Enthalpy change of phase changes.  
  - Heat of mixing.  
  - Heat effects of chemical reactions.  
  - Standard heat of formation.
