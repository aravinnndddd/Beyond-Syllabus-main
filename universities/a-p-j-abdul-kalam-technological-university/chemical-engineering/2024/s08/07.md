# PECHT865: Design and Analysis of Experiments

## Course Objectives
1. To give the students reasonably good background in statistical decision.
2. To help the students in extraction of meaningful data from well-designed minimal number of experiments at the lowest possible material costs.
3. To help the students in all domains of their life by imparting them a vision for critical appraisal and analysis of data.
