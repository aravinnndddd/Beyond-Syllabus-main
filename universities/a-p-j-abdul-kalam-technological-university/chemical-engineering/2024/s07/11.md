# PECHT754: Quantitative Risk Assessment

## Course Objectives
* Impart the basic concepts of safety in Process Industries.  
* Equip students with the skills of risk assessment techniques and hazard identification.  
* Develop an understanding about consequence analysis and quantitative risk assessment.  

---
## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Introduction to Process Safety)
* Process safety strategies: inherent, passive, active, and procedural.  
* Layer of protection, safety integrity level (SIL).  
* Hazard, risk, chemical hazards: fire, explosion, toxic gas release.  
* Dow fire & explosion index, toxicity index, chemical explosion index, inventory analysis.  
* Major industrial hazards and reasons.  
---
### Module - 2 (Hazard Identification Techniques)
* Safety audit, safety inspection, preliminary hazard analysis (PHA).  
* HAZOP, What-if analysis, fault tree analysis (FTA), event tree analysis (ETA).  
* Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), layer of protection analysis (LOPA).  
* Bow-tie analysis: methodology and examples.  
---
### Module - 3 (Consequence Analysis)
* Steps involved in consequence analysis.  
* Consequences of fire, explosion, and toxic gas release.  
* Source modelling.  
* Models for fire (pool fire), explosion (TNT equivalent), dispersion (Gaussian gas dispersion model).  
* Probit equation for fire, explosion, and toxic gas release.  
---
### Module - 4 (Quantitative Risk Assessment)
* Procedure for QRA, types of risk, acceptable risk (ALARP principle).  
* Representation of risk.  
* Calculation of individual risk and societal risk; FN curve.  
* Risk reduction strategies.  
* Emergency planning: onsite and offsite emergency plans.  
* Reliability improvement, tools for inherent safety, inherent safety indices.
