# PECHT757: Economics and Management of Chemical Industries

## Course Objectives
* Focus on economic and cost analysis of engineering projects, providing insights on tools used for cost estimation, profitability analysis, and decision-making among alternatives.  
* Provide a sound understanding of engineering economy concepts and principles and develop proficiency in methods for rational decision-making in professional practice.

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Equivalence, Cost Comparisons, Depreciation, and Taxes)
* Time value of money and equivalence, equations used in economic analysis.  
* Compound and continuous interest, uniform and capitalized cost, cost comparison with equal and unequal service life, inflation.  
* Depreciation: nature, straight line, declining balances, double declining balance, sum-of-years-digits, sinking fund, units of production methods.  
---
### Module - 2 (Analysis of Cost Estimation)
* Factors affecting investment and production costs.  
* Estimation of capital investment: types of capital cost estimates (order of magnitude, study, preliminary, definitive, detailed).  
* Cost indexes: material, labour, location.  
* Techniques of cost estimation: conference, comparison, graphic/tabular relationships, detailed item estimates, unit rate techniques, percentage of delivered equipment cost, William’s six-tenth factor, Lang factor method, hand factor method, Chilton, Miller, Peter’s, Timmerhaus ratio factor.  
* Estimation of revenue, direct and indirect production costs, variable costs, administrative expenses, start-up costs, plant overheads.  
---
### Module - 3 (Profitability Analysis and Breakeven)
* Mathematical methods for profitability evaluation: payout time without interest, return on average/original investment, net present value (NPV), NPV index, DCF rate of return, incremental analysis.  
* Breakeven and minimum cost analysis: variable/fixed cost, economic production chart at 100% capacity, above 100%, and dumping, non-linear economic production chart.  
---
### Module - 4 (Accounting)
* Principles and steps of accounting, trial balance, profit and loss accounts, balance sheet.  
* Financial ratios related to balance sheet and P&L accounts.  
* Canons of ethics for engineers.
