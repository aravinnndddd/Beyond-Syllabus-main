# PECHT746: Advanced Heat and Mass Transfer

## Course Objectives
* Analyze the phenomena of heat and mass transfer for engineering design applications.
* Understand that heat and mass transfer processes share similar mathematical models in diffusion and convection.
* Recognize that in certain cases (e.g., humidification, drying) heat and mass transfer must be considered jointly.
* Solve engineering problems involving conduction, convection, diffusion mass transfer, interphase mass transfer, and simultaneous heat and mass transfer.
