# OECHT727: Design of Experiments

## Course Objectives
1. To explore innovative strategies for constructing and executing experiments including factorial and fractional factorial designs.
2. To extract meaningful data from well-designed minimal number of experiments at the lowest possible material costs.
3. To apply statistical models in analyzing experimental data and optimize the response of interest from an experiment.

## Course Content
