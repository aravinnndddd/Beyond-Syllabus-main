# CHT302: Mass Transfer Operations II

## Course Objectives
* Explain boiling point diagrams, relative volatility, and various distillation techniques.  
* Design fractionation columns using the McCabe–Thiele method for different reflux conditions.  
* Apply the Ponchon-Savarit method to determine the number of stages required for a given separation and understand rectification in packed columns.  
* Explain the theory of extraction and design single-stage and multi-stage extraction processes with knowledge of extractors.  
* Explain the theory of leaching and design single-stage and multi-stage leaching processes with knowledge of leaching equipment.  
* Differentiate various membrane separation processes and their applications.  

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Distillation Basics
* Vapour-liquid equilibria, boiling point diagrams, equilibrium curves, relative volatility.  
* Raoult’s law and its applications.  
* Distillation methods: flash distillation, simple/differential distillation, binary distillation, steam distillation.  

### Module 2 – Fractionation and McCabe–Thiele Method
* Fractionation of binary mixtures and its principles.  
* Fractionation in plate columns, condensers, and reboilers.  
* Material and energy balances.  
* McCabe–Thiele method: feed quality, feed line, number of plates, feed plate location.  
* Reflux conditions: total reflux, minimum reflux, optimum reflux.  
* Plate efficiency, cold reflux, and open steam.  

### Module 3 – Ponchon–Savarit Method and Packed Columns

### Module 4 – Extraction
* Applications of extraction.  
* Ternary equilibria on triangular coordinates, mixer rule, distribution curves, selectivity, solvent choice.  
* Single-stage and multistage extraction for immiscible and partially miscible systems.
