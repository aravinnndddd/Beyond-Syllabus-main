# CHT303: Environmental Engineering

## Course Objectives

- Explain environmental legislation and regulations for environmental protection.
- Describe different treatment processes for drinking water, municipal water, boiler feed water, and saline water.
- Interpret primary, secondary, and tertiary wastewater treatment methods.
- Compare aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment methods.
- Select suitable treatment and disposal methods for sludge, industrial, and hazardous wastes.
- Identify sources of air and noise pollution and propose control methods.

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Water/Wastewater Treatment

- Environmental engineering overview – legislation and regulations.
- Water quality standards and treatment processes – precipitation, alum and lime soda softening.
- Municipal water conditioning, ion exchange, boiler feed water treatment, desalination.
- Sources and classification of wastewater, types of water pollutants.
- Wastewater sampling, preservation, and analysis – physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.
- Determination of solids, BOD, COD, DO (Oxygen Sag Curve), and wastewater microbiology.

### Module 2 – Wastewater Treatment Methods

- Pretreatment, primary, secondary, tertiary, and advanced treatment processes.
- Screening, grit removal, oil removal, equalization, neutralization, coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation.
- Clarifiers, clariflocculation.
- Aerobic processes – activated sludge, trickling filters, oxidation ditches, aeration lagoons, RBCs, aerobic fluidized bed bioreactors.
- Anaerobic processes – digestion, anaerobic filter, contact process, anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactors, UASB.
- Disinfection – chlorination, ozonation, adsorption sand filters.

### Module 3 – Sludge, Solid and Hazardous Waste Treatment

- Sludge treatment – thickening, conditioning, dewatering, digestion, composting.
- Solid waste – sources, classification, collection and disposal methods (open dumping, sanitary landfill, incineration, composting).
- Industrial waste treatment – pulp and paper, textile, distillery, dairy, petroleum refinery, fertilizer industry.
- Hazardous waste – types, health effects, treatment, and disposal.

### Module 4 – Air Quality and Pollution

- Air pollution – units, sources, classification, sampling, and analysis.
- Effects of air pollution – global warming, ozone depletion.
- Meteorological factors – lapse rates, pressure, wind, moisture, dispersion.
- Air quality modelling – Pasquill’s stability classes, Gaussian dispersion model, stack height design.

### Module 5 – Air and Noise Pollution Control Systems

- Air pollution control devices:
  - For particulates – gravitational settling, centrifugal collectors, wet collectors, fabric filters, ESPs.
  - For gases – adsorption, absorption, condensation, combustion, automobile emission control.
- Noise pollution – effects and control methods.
