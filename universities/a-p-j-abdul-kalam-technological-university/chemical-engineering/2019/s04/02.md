# CHT204: Heat Transfer Operations

## Course Objectives

- Identify and distinguish various modes of heat transfer and examine the mechanisms involved.
- Apply appropriate governing equations and analyse conduction heat transfer problems for different geometries under steady and transient processes.
- Solve forced and natural convection heat transfer problems using empirical equations.
- Explain the concepts behind radiation heat transfer and solve radiation heat transfer problems.
- Analyse the heat transfer processes involved in boiling and condensation.
- Design heat exchangers and evaporators after interpreting the basic concepts.

## Course Content

### Module 1 – Conduction

- Modes of heat transfer – conduction, convection, radiation; applications in engineering.
- Material properties – thermal conductivity, specific heat, isotropic/anisotropic materials.
- General heat conduction equation (derivation in Cartesian coordinates).
- Steady-state conduction through plane, cylindrical, and spherical walls (with and without heat generation).
- Composite systems, conduction-convection systems, electrical analogy.
- Critical radius of insulation, optimum thickness, thermal contact resistance.
- Unsteady-state conduction – lumped capacity analysis, Biot modulus, Fourier number.

### Module 2 – Convection

- Mechanism of convection, boundary layer concepts, convective heat transfer coefficient.
- Dimensional analysis (Rayleigh & Buckingham π theorem).
- Forced convection – empirical correlations for laminar/turbulent flow in pipes, plates, cylinders, spheres, tube banks.
- Natural convection – laminar/turbulent correlations, significance of Grashof & Rayleigh numbers.
- Analogy between momentum and heat transfer (Reynold’s analogy).

### Module 3 – Radiation, Boiling & Condensation

- Radiation heat transfer – emissive power, emissivity, black/gray bodies, radiation laws.
- Radiation between surfaces, view factors, radiation shields.
- Boiling – boiling curve, nucleate and film boiling, empirical correlations (Rohsenow, Zuber).
- Condensation – film and dropwise condensation, Nusselt analysis for vertical plate.

### Module 4 – Heat Exchangers

- Classification of heat exchangers (construction, fluids, transfer mechanisms, flow arrangements).
- Shell and tube heat exchanger – construction and components.
- Overall heat transfer coefficient, fouling factors.
- LMTD and NTU methods – equations, correction factors, design calculations.
- Temperature-distance plots for various flow arrangements.

### Module 5 – Evaporators

- Principle and types of evaporators – natural/forced circulation, film evaporators, agitated thin film, plate evaporators.
- Auxiliary components – vacuum devices, steam traps, entrainment separators.
- Single and multiple effect evaporators – capacity, economy, material & energy balances.
- Feeding arrangements – forward, backward, mixed feeding (merits & demerits).
