# MAT206: Graph Theory

## Course Objectives

This course introduces fundamental concepts in Graph Theory, including properties and characterisation of graphs/trees and graph-theoretic algorithms, which are widely used in mathematical modelling and have applications across Computer Science and other branches in Engineering.

* Explain vertices and their properties, types of paths, classification of graphs and trees & their properties. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Demonstrate the fundamental theorems on Eulerian and Hamiltonian graphs. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Illustrate the working of Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms for finding minimum cost spanning tree and Dijkstra’s and Floyd-Warshall algorithms for finding shortest paths. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Explain planar graphs, their properties and an application for planar graphs. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Illustrate how one can represent a graph in a computer. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Explain the Vertex Color problem in graphs and illustrate an example application for vertex coloring. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
