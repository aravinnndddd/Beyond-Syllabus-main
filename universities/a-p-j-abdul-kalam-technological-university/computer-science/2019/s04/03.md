# CST204: Database Management Systems

## Course Objectives

This course provides a clear understanding of fundamental principles of Database Management Systems (DBMS) with special focus on relational databases. Topics include basic DBMS concepts, ER modeling, relational algebra, SQL, normalization, indexing, transaction management, and an introduction to NoSQL systems. It helps learners manage data effectively using appropriate structures and tools for building real-world applications.

* Summarize and exemplify fundamental nature and characteristics of database systems (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Model real world scenarios given as informal descriptions, using Entity Relationship diagrams (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Model and design solutions for efficiently representing and querying data using relational model (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Analyze)  
* Demonstrate the features of indexing and hashing in database applications (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Discuss and compare the aspects of Concurrency Control and Recovery in Database systems (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Explain various types of NoSQL databases (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)
