# CST202: Computer Organization and Architecture

## Course Objectives

The course is designed to enable learners to understand the fundamental architecture of a digital computer. It builds a foundation for understanding hardware behind code execution, interaction with memory and I/O, and system-level design aspects.

* Recognize and express the relevance of basic components, I/O organization and pipelining schemes in a digital computer (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Explain the types of memory systems and mapping functions used in memory systems (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Demonstrate the control signals required for the execution of a given instruction (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Illustrate the design of Arithmetic Logic Unit and explain the usage of registers in it (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Explain the implementation aspects of arithmetic algorithms in a digital computer (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Develop the control logic for a given arithmetic problem (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
