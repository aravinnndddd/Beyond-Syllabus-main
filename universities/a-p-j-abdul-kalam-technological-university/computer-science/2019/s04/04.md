# CST206: Operating Systems

## Course Objectives

This course introduces the fundamental design principles of operating systems. Learners will explore key OS functionalities such as memory management, process management, device handling, file systems, and protection mechanisms. The course enables students to analyze and extend OS features to optimize performance and solve operating system-related issues.

* Explain the relevance, structure and functions of Operating Systems in computing devices. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Illustrate the concepts of process management and process scheduling mechanisms employed in Operating Systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Explain process synchronization in Operating Systems and illustrate synchronization mechanisms using Mutex Locks, Semaphores, and Monitors. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Explain any one method for detection, prevention, avoidance, and recovery for managing deadlocks in Operating Systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Explain the memory management algorithms in Operating Systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Explain the security aspects and algorithms for file and storage management in Operating Systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)
