# EST130 - Basics of Civil and Mechanical Engineering Workshop

---

## PART I: CIVIL WORKSHOP

### Exercises

- **Exercise 1**: Calculate the area of a built-up space and a small parcel of land using standard measuring tape and digital distance measuring devices.
- **Exercise 2**:  
  - Use screw gauge and vernier caliper to measure the diameter of a steel rod and thickness of a flat bar.  
  - Transfer the level from one point to another using a water level.  
  - Set out a one-room building with a given plan and measuring tape.
- **Exercise 3**: Find the level difference between any two points using a dumpy level.
- **Exercise 4**:  
  - Construct a 1½ thick brick wall of 50 cm height and 60 cm length using English bond. Use spirit level to assess the tilt of walls.  
  - Estimate the number of different types of building blocks to construct this wall.
- **Exercise 5**:  
  - Introduce students to plumbing tools, different types of pipes, connections, traps, valves, fixtures, and sanitary fittings.  
  - Install a small rainwater harvesting system in the campus.
