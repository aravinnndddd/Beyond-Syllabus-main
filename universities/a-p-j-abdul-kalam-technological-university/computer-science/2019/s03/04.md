# CST205: Logic System Design

## Course Objectives

* Illustrate decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal and BCD number systems, perform conversions among them and do the operations - complementation, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on binary numbers (Cognitive Knowledge level: Understand)  
* Simplify a given Boolean Function and design a combinational circuit to implement the simplified function using Digital Logic Gates (Cognitive Knowledge level: Apply)  
* Design combinational circuits - Adders, Code Convertors, Decoders, Magnitude Comparators, Parity Generator/Checker and design the Programmable Logic Devices - ROM and PLA. (Cognitive Knowledge level: Apply)  
* Design sequential circuits - Registers, Counters and Shift Registers. (Cognitive Knowledge level: Apply)  
* Use algorithms to perform addition and subtraction on binary, BCD and floating point numbers (Cognitive Knowledge level: Understand)
