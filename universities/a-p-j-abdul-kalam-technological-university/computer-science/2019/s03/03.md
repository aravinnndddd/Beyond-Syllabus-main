# CST204: Object Oriented Programming using Java

## Course Objectives

* Write Java programs using the object-oriented concepts - classes, objects, constructors, data hiding, inheritance, and polymorphism (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Utilise datatypes, operators, control statements, built-in packages & interfaces, Input/Output Streams and Files in Java to develop programs (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Illustrate how robust programs can be written in Java using exception handling mechanism (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Write application programs in Java using multithreading and database connectivity (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Write Graphical User Interface based application programs by utilising event handling features and Swing in Java (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)
