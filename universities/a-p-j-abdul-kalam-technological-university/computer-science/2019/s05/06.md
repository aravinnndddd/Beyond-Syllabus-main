# CST381: Concepts in Software Engineering

## Course Objectives
* Differentiate Traditional and Agile Software Development approaches.
* Prepare Software Requirement Specification and Software Design for a given problem.
* Justify the significance of design patterns and licensing terms in software development, and prepare testing, maintenance and DevOps strategies for a project.
* Apply software project management concepts while planning, estimation, scheduling, tracking and change management of a project using SCRUM, Kanban and Lean frameworks.
* Utilize SQA practices, Process Improvement techniques and Technology improvements such as cloud-based software models, containers and microservices in software development.
