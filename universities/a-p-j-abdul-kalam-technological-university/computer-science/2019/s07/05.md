# CST443: Model Based Software Development

## Course Objectives

* Explain the relevance of model-based software development in the software development process. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Explain Model Driven Architecture with Computation Independent Model (CIM), Platform Independent Model (PIM), Platform Specific Model (PSM). (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Illustrate software modeling with Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Explain error annex using error modelling concepts and illustrate error modelling in AADL. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  
* Illustrate the process of code generation from an AADL model. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)  

## Course Content

### Module 1: Introduction to Model Based Software Development

* Software faults  
* Introduction to Model checking  
* Introduction to Automated Testing  
* Model Based Software Development (MBSD) – Need, MBSD Approach  
* Learning MBSD from the perspective of Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)  

### Module 2: More on MBSD

* MBSD based software development – Requirements, Analysis, Design, and Implementation  
* Model-Driven Architecture – Definitions and Assumptions  
* Overview of MBSD methodology  
* Modeling levels – Computation Independent Model (CIM), Platform Independent Model (PIM), Platform Specific Model (PSM)  
* Introduction to AADL  
* Comparison of AADL with other modeling languages (UML)  

### Module 3: Modeling using AADL

* Developing a simple model – Define the components  
* Example: Powerboat Autopilot System  
* Top-level model development  
* AADL components:  
  - Software, Hardware, Composite  
  - Runtime semantics, Language syntax  
  - AADL declarations, Classifiers  
  - AADL system models and specifications  
* Case Study: Powerboat Autopilot System  

### Module 4: Model Analysis

  - Error Model Libraries, Subclause Annotations  
  - Error Types and Ontology  
  - Error Sources and Their Impact  
  - Component Error Behavior, Compositional Abstraction  
  - Use of Properties in Architecture Fault Models  
* Error Modeling Example  

### Module 5: Code Generation

* Need for code generation  
* Categorization and techniques  
* Code Generation in AADL using Ocarina
