# CST401: Artificial Intelligence

## Course Objectives

This course introduces the fundamental concepts and problem-solving approaches of intelligent systems, including knowledge representation, inference, search, and learning techniques.

* Explain the fundamental concepts of intelligent systems and their architecture. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understanding)  
* Illustrate uninformed and informed search techniques for problem solving in intelligent systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understanding)  
* Solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems using search techniques. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Represent AI domain knowledge using logic systems and use inference techniques for reasoning in intelligent systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Apply)  
* Illustrate different types of learning techniques used in intelligent systems. (Cognitive Knowledge Level: Understand)
