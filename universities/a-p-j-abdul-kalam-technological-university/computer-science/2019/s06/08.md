# CST362: Programming in Python

## Course Objectives
* Write, test and debug Python programs.
* Illustrate uses of conditional (if, if-else and if-elif-else) and iterative (while and for) statements in Python programs.
* Develop programs by utilizing the Python programming constructs such as Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries.
* Develop graphical user interface for solutions using Python libraries.
* Implement object-oriented programs with exception handling.
* Write programs in Python to process data stored in files by utilizing NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
