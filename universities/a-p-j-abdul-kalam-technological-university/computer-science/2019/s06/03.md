# CST306: Algorithm Analysis and Design

## Course Objectives
* Analyze any given algorithm and express its time and space complexities in asymptotic notations.
* Derive recurrence equations and solve them using iteration, recurrence tree, substitution and master’s method to compute time complexity of algorithms.
* Illustrate graph traversal algorithms and applications, and advanced data structures like AVL trees and disjoint set operations.
* Demonstrate divide-and-conquer, greedy strategy, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound and backtracking algorithm design techniques.
* Classify a problem as computationally tractable or intractable, and discuss strategies to address intractability.
* Identify the suitable design strategy to solve a given problem.
