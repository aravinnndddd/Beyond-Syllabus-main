# CST302: Compiler Design

## Course Objectives
* Explain the phases in compilation process including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization and code generation, and model a lexical analyzer.
* Model language syntax using Context Free Grammar and develop parse tree representation using leftmost and rightmost derivations.
* Compare different types of parsers (bottom-up and top-down) and construct a parser for a given grammar.
* Build syntax directed translation for a context free grammar, compare various storage allocation strategies and classify intermediate representations.
* Illustrate code optimization and code generation techniques in compilation.

## Course Content
