# CST454: Fuzzy Set Theory and Applications  

## Course Objectives  
* Explain fuzzy logic-based problem solving.  
* Summarize the concepts of crisp sets, crisp relations, crisp logic, fuzzy sets, fuzzy relations, and fuzzy logic.  
* Develop fuzzy systems by selecting appropriate membership functions, fuzzification, and defuzzification methods.  
* Develop solutions using graphical and rule-based methods.  
* Use fuzzy logic inference to solve real-world problems.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Basic Fuzzy Set Theory  
* The case for imprecision, utility and limitations of fuzzy systems.  
* Fuzzy sets and membership.  
* Classical sets – properties and operations.  
* Fuzzy sets – properties and operations.  
* Classical relations – Cartesian product, operations, and properties.  
* Fuzzy relations – cardinality, operations, properties, fuzzy Cartesian product and composition.  

### Module 2 – Fuzzy Membership Functions  
* Tolerance and equivalence relations – crisp and fuzzy.  
* Similarity methods – cosine, min-max.  
* Fuzzy membership functions – features, fuzzification, defuzzification to crisp sets, λ-cuts for fuzzy relations.  
* Linguistic hedges.  

### Module 3 – Fuzzification and Defuzzification Methods  
* Development of membership functions – intuition, inference, rank ordering, inductive reasoning.  
* Defuzzification to scalars – max membership principle, centroid method, weighted average method, mean max membership, center of sums, center of largest area, first/last of maxima.  

### Module 4 – Fuzzy Inference  
* Classical logic and fuzzy logic.  
* Approximate reasoning.  
* Fuzzy (rule-based) systems – multiple conjunctive antecedents, multiple disjunctive antecedents, aggregation of fuzzy rules.  
* Graphical techniques of inference.  

### Module 5 – Fuzzy Applications  
* Applications of fuzzy systems – classification, pattern recognition, control systems, fuzzy systems with neural networks, clustering, databases, and information retrieval systems.
