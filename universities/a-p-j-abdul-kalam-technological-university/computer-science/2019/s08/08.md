# CST474: Computer Vision  

## Course Objectives  
* Summarize basic concepts, terminology, theories, models and methods in the field of computer vision.  
* Explain basic methods of computer vision related to multi-scale representation, edge detection, detection of other primitives, stereo, motion and object recognition.  
* Describe principles of segmentation, motion segmentation and classification.  
* Select appropriate object tracking and detection methods for computer vision applications.  
* Implement a computer vision system for a specific problem.
