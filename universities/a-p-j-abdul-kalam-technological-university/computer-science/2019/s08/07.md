# CST464: Embedded Systems  

## Course Objectives  
* Describe the characteristics of different hardware/software components of an embedded system.  
* Map the design of an embedded system to an appropriate computational model.  
* Recommend appropriate process synchronization, communication, and scheduling mechanisms for specific system scenarios.  
* Describe the role of real-time operating systems in embedded devices.  
* Apply design strategies for developing real-world embedded systems.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction to Embedded Systems  
* Definitions, Embedded Systems vs. General Computing Systems, History, Classification, Application Areas, Purpose.  
* Building blocks of a typical embedded system – System core (Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, DSP, ASICs, PLDs), memory (ROMs and RAMs), sensors and actuators, I/O subsystem interface, communication interface, embedded firmware, reset/brown-out protection circuits, oscillator unit, real-time clock, watchdog timer, PCB.  
* Embedded system design process – requirements, specification, architecture design, designing hardware and software components, system integration.  

### Module 2 – System Modeling and Hardware-Software Co-Design  
* Computational models in embedded design – Data Flow Graph, Control Data Flow Graph, State Machine Model, Sequential Program Model, Concurrent Process Model, Object-Oriented Model.  
* Hardware-software co-design – traditional development cycle, advantages, co-design process, issues in co-design, hardware-software trade-offs.  

### Module 3 – Real-Time Embedded System Design  
* OS basics, types of OS, tasks, processes, threads, multiprocessing, multitasking.  
* Task scheduling – non-preemptive (FIFO, LIFO, SJF) and preemptive (SRT, RR, priority-based, rate-based).  
* Task communication – shared memory, message passing, RPC, sockets.  
* Task synchronization – race condition, deadlock, priority inversion, inheritance, ceiling.  
* Synchronization techniques – spin lock, sleep & wakeup, semaphores.  
* Selection of an RTOS – functional and non-functional requirements.  

### Module 4 – Embedded Firmware Design, Development, and EDLC  
* Firmware design approaches, firmware development languages, integration of hardware and firmware.  
* Embedded product development life cycle – objectives, phases, modeling techniques: waterfall, incremental, evolutionary, spiral models.  

### Module 5 – Embedded System Industry: Case Studies and Applications  
* Case studies – battery-operated smart card reader, automated meter reading system, smartwatch.  
* Automotive and aerospace systems – networked control systems in cars and airplanes, vehicular networks (CAN bus, TTA, FlexRay, LIN).  
* IoT systems – architectures, use cases (smart appliances, monitoring and control), networks (Bluetooth, BLE, 802.15.4, ZigBee, WiFi), databases, timewheels, smart home example.
