# PECST869: Computational Number Theory

## Course Objectives

1. To develop proficiency in key algorithms for number-theoretic operations, including primality testing, integer factorization, and modular exponentiation, and to analyze and implement these algorithms efficiently to solve problems in number theory and cryptography.  
2. To apply advanced computational techniques, such as elliptic curve cryptography and lattice-based methods, to address complex problems in cryptographic systems and gain practical skills to implement and evaluate these techniques within real-world security applications.
