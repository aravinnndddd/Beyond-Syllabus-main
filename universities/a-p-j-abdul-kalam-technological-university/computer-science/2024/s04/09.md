# PECST416: Signals and Systems

## Course Objectives

1. To teach the concept of a Discrete Time (DT) signal.  
2. To enable the learner to analyze the spectral information of any DT signal and its transformed version.  
3. To provide the learner with the concepts of a DT system, its behavior to an arbitrary input, and how to analyze it using z-transform.
