# PECST525: Data Mining

## Course Objectives

1. To provide a thorough understanding of the key processes and concepts involved in data mining and data warehousing within application domains.  
2. To enable students to understand the different data pre-processing techniques, fundamentals and advanced concepts of classification, clustering, association rule mining, text mining and web mining, and apply these techniques in real-world scenarios.
