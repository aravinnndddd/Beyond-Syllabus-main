# PCCST603 - Compiler Design

## Course Objectives

1. Provide a comprehensive understanding of the compiler construction process through its various phases: lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.
2. Introduce compiler construction tools like Lex and YACC and their use in lexical analysis and parsing.
