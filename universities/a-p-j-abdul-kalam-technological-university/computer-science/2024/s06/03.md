## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Software Testing & Automation

- Concepts and importance of software testing, quality assurance, real-world failures (e.g., Ariane 5, Therac 25)  
- Software Testing Processes, Testing Terminologies: Verification, validation, faults, errors, bugs, test cases, coverage  
- Types of Testing: Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, Performance (stress, usability, regression), Security  
- Industry Trends: AI in test case automation, GenAI in testing  
- Testing Methods: Black-box, White-box, Grey-box  
- Automation Tools: Selenium, Cypress, JUnit  
- Case Study: Automation of unit testing and mutation testing using JUnit

### Module 2: Unit Testing, Mutation Testing & AI-Driven Automation

- Unit Testing: Static and dynamic, control flow, data flow, domain testing  
- Mutation Testing: Operators, mutants, mutation score, tools (e.g., Muclipse)  
- JUnit Framework: Automation of unit testing in real-world projects  
- AI in Testing: GenAI for test generation/optimization, predictive automation  
- Industry Tools: AI-driven testing tools  
- Case Study: Mutation testing using JUnit and AI-enhanced automation

### Module 3: Advanced White Box Testing & Security Testing

- Graph Coverage Criteria: Node, edge, path, prime path, round trip coverage  
- Data Flow Criteria: du paths, du pairs, subsumption  
- Graph Coverage for Code: Control flow graphs (CFGs), loops, exceptions  
- Graph Coverage for Design: Call graphs, inheritance, coupling data-flow pairs  
- Security Testing: Tools (OWASP, Burp Suite), testing modern applications  
- Case Study: Graph-based and security testing using industry-standard tools

### Module 4: Black Box, Grey Box, and Responsive Testing

- Black Box Testing: Input space partitioning, domain testing, functional testing (ECP, BVA, decision tables, random testing)  
- Grey Box Testing: Introduction, benefits, matrix, regression, orthogonal array testing  
- Performance Testing: Network latency, browser compatibility, responsive testing (BrowserStack, LambdaTest)  
- PEX Framework: Symbolic execution, parameterized testing, symbolic execution trees  
- GenAI: Advanced applications in predictive/responsive testing  
- Case Study: Black-box, grey-box, and responsive testing with PEX and AI tools
