## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to Software Testing & Automation
- Concepts, importance of testing, software quality, and real-world failures (e.g., Ariane 5, Therac 25)  
- Software testing processes – levels of thinking in testing  
- Testing terminologies – verification, validation, fault, error, bug, test cases, coverage criteria  
- Types of testing – unit, integration, system, acceptance, performance (stress, usability, regression), security  
- Industry trends – AI in test case automation, introduction to GenAI in testing  
- Testing methods – black-box, white-box, grey-box  
- Automation tools – introduction (Selenium, Cypress, JUnit)  
- Case study – automation of unit testing and mutation testing using JUnit  

### Module 2: Unit Testing, Mutation Testing & AI-Driven Automation
- Unit testing – static and dynamic, control flow testing, data flow testing, domain testing  
- Mutation testing – mutation operators, mutants, mutation score, modern mutation tools (Muclipse)  
- JUnit framework – automation of unit testing, frameworks for real-world projects  
- AI in testing – GenAI for test case generation and optimization, impact on automation  
- Industry tools – AI-driven testing tools for automation and predictive testing  
- Case study – mutation testing using JUnit, AI-enhanced test case automation  

### Module 3: Advanced White-Box Testing & Security Testing
- Graph coverage criteria – node, edge, path coverage; prime path and round trip coverage  
- Data flow criteria – du paths, du pairs, subsumption relationships  
- Graph coverage for code – control flow graphs (CFGs) for loops, exceptions  
- Graph coverage for design – call graphs, class inheritance testing, coupling data-flow pairs  
- Security testing – fundamentals, tools (OWASP, Burp Suite), protecting modern applications  
- Case study – graph-based testing and security testing using industry tools  

### Module 4: Black-Box, Grey-Box & Responsive Testing
- Black-box testing – input space partitioning, domain testing, functional testing (equivalence class partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision tables, random testing)  
- Grey-box testing – introduction, advantages, methodologies (matrix testing, regression testing, orthogonal array testing)  
- Performance testing – network latency testing, browser compatibility, responsive testing across devices (BrowserStack, LambdaTest)  
- Introduction to PEX – symbolic execution, parameterized unit testing, symbolic execution trees  
- GenAI in testing – predictive and responsive testing use cases  
- Case study – black-box, grey-box, and responsive testing using PEX and AI-driven tools
