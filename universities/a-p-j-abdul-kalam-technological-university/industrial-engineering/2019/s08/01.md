# Data Science with Julia

## course objectives
- To impart a thorough understanding of the Julia language and its package ecosystem.  
- To perform advanced analytics and optimization using Julia's powerful libraries.  

## syllabus

### Module 1: Basic Programming in Julia (9 hours)
- Julia installation and setup.  
- Variables and basic data types.  
- Core data structures: arrays, tuples, dictionaries.  
- Control flow (if, for, while), functions, modules and packages.  
- Input/output operations and basic file handling.

### Module 2: Advanced Programming (9 hours)
- Object-oriented and functional programming patterns in Julia.  
- Metaprogramming and macros.  
- Parallel and concurrent computing basics (multi-threading, distributed).  
- Working with Dates/Times and tabular data using DataFrames.jl.  
- Package management (Pkg), testing and documentation basics.

### Module 3: Statistical Analysis (9 hours)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning workflows.  
- Hypothesis testing and statistical inference (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA).  
- Time series basics and forecasting workflows.  
- Introductory machine learning: regression, classification, clustering using MLJ/Flux or equivalent libraries.  
- Model evaluation, cross-validation and performance metrics.

### Module 4: Optimization (9 hours)
- Formulation of linear programming problems and solving with JuMP.  
- Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) modelling and solvers.  
- Vehicle routing and combinatorial optimization case studies.  
- Nonlinear programming and use of nonlinear solvers.  
- Practical projects combining data analysis and optimization.
