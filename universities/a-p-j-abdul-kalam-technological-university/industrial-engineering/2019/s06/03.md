## syllabus

### Module 1: Introduction and Descriptive Statistics (9 hours)
- Need for data analysis, collection, organization, and presentation of data.  
- Primary types of measurement scales: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio.  
- Deciles, quartiles, and percentiles.  
- Measures of central tendency and variability.  
- Skewness and kurtosis.  
- Chebyshev’s Theorem and the Empirical Rule.  

### Module 2: Probability Distributions (9 hours)
- Types of probability distributions: discrete and continuous.  
- Random variables and expected value.  
- Overview of Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, Triangular, Weibull, Uniform, Normal, Gamma, and Exponential distributions.  

### Module 3: Sampling and Sampling Distributions (9 hours)

- Sampling process: probability and non-probability sampling methods.  
- Determination of sample size.  
- Introduction to sampling distributions and the Central Limit Theorem.  
- Estimators: properties, point estimates, interval estimates, and confidence intervals.  

### Module 4: Hypothesis Testing & Analysis of Variance (10 hours)
- Hypothesis testing: one-sample and two-sample tests (z-test, t-test, Chi-square test, F-test).  
- Non-parametric methods: K-S test, Sign test for paired data, One-sample Runs test, Rank sum tests (Mann–Whitney U-test, Kruskal–Wallis test).  
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA): theory, computations, ANOVA table.
