# Operations Research

## course outcomes

- **CO1**: Recall the use of Operations Research, demonstrate linear programming problem modelling skills and develop solutions to help decision making.  
- **CO2**: Illustrate modelling skills and apply solution skills to transportation and assignment problems.  
- **CO3**: Interpret queuing situations and apply queuing theory to solve queuing system models.  
- **CO4**: Interpret game theory applications to develop solutions for industrial problems of game theoretic nature.  
- **CO5**: Summarize the use of dynamic programming to construct solution procedures for various engineering and management problems.  
- **CO6**: Explain decision theory applications to real life problems and build solutions to industrial problems that require decision theory support.  
- **CO7**: Formulate suitable replacement strategies for items that deteriorate over time or fail suddenly, and introduce software packages for decision making.
