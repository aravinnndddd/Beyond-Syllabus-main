- **CO3**: Understand basic concepts of numerical methods used for solving mathematical problems.  
- **CO4**: Develop object-oriented computer programs using numerical methods for solving mathematical problems.  

## syllabus

### Module 1: Fundamentals of C++ (8 hours)
- Structure of C++ program, keywords, identifiers, data types, operators, statements.  
- Control statements: `if`, `if-else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `do-while`, `break`, `continue`.  
- Arrays: one-dimensional and two-dimensional.  
- Functions: inline functions, function overloading, default arguments, recursion.  
- Basics of pointers. Function call by value and by reference.  
- Simple programs using the above features.  

### Module 2: OOP Fundamentals (8 hours)
- Class and object: definition, data members, member functions, private & public members, member access.  
- Friend declaration, class objects.  
- Inheritance: base class and derived class.  
- Simple programs using these features.  

### Module 3: OOP Concepts (8 hours)
- Comparison of procedure-oriented programming (POP) and object-oriented programming (OOP).  
- OOP concepts: abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, data hierarchy through inheritance and polymorphism.  
- Operator overloading in C++.  
- Class methods, class friends, initialization and assignment of objects.  
- Constructors and destructors in C++ classes.  
- Simple programs using these features.  

### Module 4: Numerical Methods 1 (8 hours)
- Errors and approximations, sources of errors.  
- Solution of linear systems: Gauss elimination, Gauss–Jordan, Gauss–Seidel methods.  
- Curve fitting: method of least squares.  
- Partial differential equations: classification, Laplace equation, finite difference method.  
- Numerical problems and C++ OOP-based programs for these methods.  

### Module 5: Numerical Methods 2 (8 hours)
- Root finding: Bisection method, Regula-Falsi method, Newton–Raphson method.  
- Interpolation: Lagrange interpolation.  
- Numerical integration: trapezoidal rule, Simpson’s 1/3rd rule.  
- Numerical problems and C++ OOP-based programs for these methods.
