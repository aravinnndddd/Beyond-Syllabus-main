# Machine Tools and Digital Manufacturing

## course outcomes

- **CO1**: Explain the mechanism of metal removal in machining and assess the material removal rate, power required, and surface finish during a machining process, and select the optimal tool material, feed rate, depth of cut, and coolants for a machining process.  
- **CO2**: Decide the optimal machining parameters and machining sequence to realise a product.  
- **CO3**: Program CNC machines; understand the setting up of CNC machines and use CAD/CAM software in production engineering.  
- **CO4**: Explain the concept of digital manufacturing and appreciate its use in modern manufacturing systems.  
- **CO5**: Explain industrial automation and its components as per Industry 4.0.  
- **CO6**: Explain the concepts and methods of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).
