# EET436: Power Quality  

## Course Objectives  
- Identify the sources and effects of power quality problems.  
- Apply Fourier concepts for harmonic analysis.  
- Explain the important aspects of power quality monitoring.  
- Examine power quality mitigation techniques.  
- Discuss power quality issues in grid-connected renewable energy systems.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 (14 hours)  
- Power quality phenomenon – sources and effects, need for concern.  
- Types of power quality disturbances – transients (classification and origin), short-duration voltage variation (interruption, sag, swell), long-duration voltage variation, voltage unbalance, waveform distortion (notching, harmonics), voltage flicker.  

### Module 2  
- Harmonics – mechanism of generation, triplen harmonics, sources (switching devices, arcing devices, saturable devices).  
- Effects on power system equipment and loads – transformers, capacitor banks, motors, telecommunication systems.  
- Effect of triplen harmonics on neutral current, line and phase voltages.  
- Harmonic analysis using Fourier series and Fourier transforms (simple numerical problems).  

### Module 3 (6 hours)  
- Harmonic indices – CF, DF, THD, TDD, TIF, DIN, C-message weights.  
- Displacement and total power factor.  
- Overview of power quality standards: IEEE 519, IEEE 1433, IEC 61000.  
- Power quality monitoring – objectives, measurement issues, instruments (power quality analyzer, harmonic spectrum analyzer, flicker meters).  

### Module 4 (8 hours)  
- Mitigation of power quality problems – harmonic elimination, design and analysis of passive filters (simple problems), demerits of passive filters.  
- Active filters – shunt, series, hybrid filters.  
- Sag and swell correction using DVR.  
- Power quality conditioners – DSTATCOM, UPQC (configuration and working).  

### Module 5 (6 hours)  
- Power factor correction – single-phase active power factor converter (circuit schematic and control block diagram).  
- Power quality issues of grid-connected renewable energy systems – operating conflicts.  
- Grounding and wiring – reasons, problems, solutions.  

*Assignments are encouraged involving case studies using power quality instruments for practical exposure.*
