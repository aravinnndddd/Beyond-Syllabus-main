## Course Objectives  
- Develop the basic design for non-isolated DC-DC converter topologies.  
- Analyse isolated DC-DC converter topologies.  
- Describe the operation of switched-mode inverters and rectifiers.  
- Distinguish between inverter modulation strategies.  
- Describe the operation of soft switching resonant converters.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Switched Mode Non-Isolated DC-DC Converters (6 hours)  
- Linear vs switching power electronics.  
- Buck, Boost, Buck-Boost and Ćuk converters: steady-state analysis, inductor volt-second and capacitor amp-second balance.  
- Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM): Voltage gain, filter inductor and capacitor design, boundary between CCM and DCM.  
- Critical values of inductance/load resistance, examples for buck and boost converters.  
- Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) for buck converter: output voltage ripple and voltage gain in DCM.  

### Module 2 – Isolated DC-DC Converters (8 hours)  
- High-frequency transformers for DC-DC converters (unidirectional & bidirectional excitation).  
- Flyback converter (CCM and DCM): operation, waveforms, voltage gain.  
- Double-ended flyback converter (CCM).  
- Forward converter: basic, practical with core reset, double-ended.  
- Push-Pull, Half-Bridge, Full-Bridge converters (CCM), flux-walking.  
- Current-source DC-DC converter.  

### Module 3 – Switched Mode DC-AC Converters (6 hours)  
- Review of single-phase bridge inverters.  
- Three-phase sine-PWM inverter: linear modulation, RMS voltages, overmodulation, square-wave operation.  
- Switch utilisation ratio (1-phase & 3-phase).  
- PWM rectifiers: current harmonics in diode bridge, power factor improvement.  
- Active shaping of input line current (PFC boost converter), single-phase switched-mode rectifier.  

### Module 4 – Modulation Schemes (6 hours)  
- Space Vector Modulation (SVM): concept, reference vector, switching times, sequence.  
- Comparison of sine-PWM & SVM.  
- Hysteresis current control.  

### Module 5 – Soft-Switching and Resonant Converters (8 hours)  
- Programmed harmonic elimination in single-phase inverters.  
- Current-controlled voltage source inverter.  
- Hard-switched vs soft-switched converters.  
- Resonant converters: basic concepts, series and parallel resonant circuits, series/parallel loaded converters (DCM with ωs < 0.5 ωr).  
- Resonant switch (quasi-resonant) converters: ZCS buck (L-type), ZVS buck, comparison of ZCS & ZVS converters.
