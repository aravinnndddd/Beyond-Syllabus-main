# EET446: Computer Networks  

## Course Objectives  
- Explain computer networks, layered architecture, protocols, and physical media used for setting up a network.  
- Identify the role of the data link layer, MAC sublayer, and networking devices in Ethernets and wireless LANs.  
- Explain routing algorithms, congestion control algorithms, and techniques to achieve good quality of service.  
- Illustrate IP address classes, ICMP protocols, and other external routing protocols.  
- Explain the services provided by the transport layer and application layer.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction and Physical Layer  
- Uses of computer networks, network hardware and software.  
- Protocol hierarchies, design issues, connection-oriented vs connectionless service.  
- Reference models – OSI and TCP/IP, comparison.  
- Physical layer – transmission media (twisted pair, fiber optics).  
- Performance indicators – bandwidth, throughput, latency, bandwidth–delay product.  

### Module 2 – Data Link Layer  
- Design issues, error detection and correction, sliding window protocols.  
- MAC sublayer – channel allocation problem, multiple access protocols (CSMA, collision-free protocols).  
- Ethernet – switched, fast, and gigabit Ethernet.  

### Module 3 – Network Layer  
- Wireless LANs – IEEE 802.11 architecture and protocol stack.  
- Networking devices – bridges, repeaters, hubs, switches, routers, gateways.  
- Routing algorithms – optimality principle, shortest path, flooding, distance vector, link state, mobile host routing.  
- Congestion control (overview).  
- Quality of Service (QoS) – requirements, traffic shaping, packet scheduling.  

### Module 4 – Network Layer in the Internet  
- IPv4, IP addresses, IPv6.  
- Internet control protocols – ICMP, ARP, DHCP.  
- OSPF, BGP, internet multicasting.  

### Module 5 – Transport and Application Layers  
- Transport services, primitives.  
- UDP – basics, remote procedure call.  
- TCP – service model, protocol, segment header, connection establishment and release.  
- Application layer – DNS (namespace, name servers), email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3), WWW (architecture, HTTP), FTP.
