## Modules  

### Module 1 – Power Semiconductor Devices (11 Hours)  
* Introduction to Power Electronics – scope and applications – comparison with signal electronics.  
* Power devices: Power diode, Power MOSFET, IGBT – structure, principle of operation, switching characteristics, comparison.  
* Wideband gap devices – basics of SiC and GaN devices.  
* SCR – structure, static and switching characteristics – di/dt & dv/dt protection, turn-on methods, two-transistor analogy.  
* Gate triggering circuits – isolation and synchronization requirements – opto and pulse transformer-based isolation.  

### Module 2 – Controlled Rectifiers (9 Hours)  
* Single-phase controlled rectifiers – half-wave controlled rectifier with R load.  
* Fully controlled and half-controlled bridge rectifiers with R, RL, and RLE loads (continuous & discontinuous conduction) – output voltage equations and simple problems.  
* Three-phase controlled rectifiers – half-wave and fully/half-controlled bridge converters with RLE load (continuous conduction, ripple-free) – output voltage equations and waveforms.  

### Module 3 – AC Voltage Controllers & Inverters (9 Hours)  
* AC Voltage Controllers – single-phase full-wave ACVC with R & RL loads – RMS output voltage, input power factor.  
* Inverters – voltage source inverters: single-phase half-bridge & full-bridge, three-phase bridge inverters (120° and 180° conduction) – THD in output voltage.  
* Current source inverters – single-phase capacitor commutated CSI.  
* PWM techniques – single pulse width, multiple pulse width, sine-triangle PWM (unipolar & bipolar) – modulation index, frequency modulation ratio.  

### Module 4 – DC-DC Converters (8 Hours)  
* Step-down and step-up choppers – single, two, and four-quadrant choppers.  
* PWM and current limit control in DC-DC converters.
