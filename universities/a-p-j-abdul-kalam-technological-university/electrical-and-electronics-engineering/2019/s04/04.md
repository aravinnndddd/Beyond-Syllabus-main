## Course Objectives  
* Identify various number systems, binary codes and formulate digital functions using Boolean algebra.  
* Design and implement combinational logic circuits.  
* Design and implement sequential logic circuits.  
* Compare the operation of various analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion circuits.  
* Explain the basic concepts of programmable logic devices and VHDL.  

## Modules
