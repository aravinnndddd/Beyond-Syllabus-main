# EET204: Electromagnetic Theory  

## Course Objectives  
* Apply vector analysis and coordinate systems to solve static electric and magnetic field problems.  
* Apply Gauss’s law, Coulomb’s law and Poisson's equation to determine electrostatic field parameters.  
* Determine magnetic fields from current distributions by applying Biot-Savart's law and Ampere’s circuital law.  
* Apply Maxwell’s equations for the solution of time-varying fields.  
* Analyse electromagnetic wave propagation in different media.
