# EET453: Digital Signal Processing  

## Course Objectives  
- Compute Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  
- Discuss the various structures for realization of IIR and FIR discrete-time systems.  
- Design IIR (Butterworth and Chebyshev) digital filters using impulse invariant and bilinear transformation methods.  
- Design FIR filters using frequency sampling method and window function method.  
- Compare fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic used in digital signal processors and discuss the finite word length effects.  
- Explain the architecture of digital signal processors and the applications of DSP.
