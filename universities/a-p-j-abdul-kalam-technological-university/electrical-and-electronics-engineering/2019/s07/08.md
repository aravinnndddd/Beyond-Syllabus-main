# EET473: Digital Protection of Power Systems  

## Course Objectives  
- Identify the relay protection scheme suitable for overcurrent, differential, and distance protection.  
- Develop protection schemes for bus bars, transformers, generators, motors, and distribution systems using appropriate protective relays.  
- Illustrate the operation of numerical relays.  
- Explain signal processing methods and algorithms in digital protection.  
- Infer emerging protection schemes in power systems.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Introduction to Protection and Relays (8 hours)  
- Need for protective systems, zones of protection.  
- Current and voltage transformers (EM and CVT), magneto-optic CT/PT.  
- Relays: overcurrent relays (time-current characteristics, definite time, IDMT, directional), differential relays (operating/restraining characteristics, types), distance relays (impedance, reactance, mho, quadrilateral, elliptical).  

### Module 2 – Protection of Power System Components (8 hours)  
- Distance protection schemes, differential line protection, phase comparison, carrier-based protection, effect of power swings.  
- Bus-bar, transformer, generator, and motor protection (differential, high/low impedance schemes, harmonic restraint, REF, frame leakage, stator and rotor protection).  
- Pilot relaying: pilot wire, carrier current protection.  
- Distribution system protection: criteria, directional and non-directional schemes, travelling wave protection.  

### Module 3 – Numerical Relays and Signal Conditioning (8 hours)  
- Components and block diagram of numerical relays, processing unit, HMI, principle of operation.  
- Comparison with electromechanical and static relays, advantages, IEC 61850, SAS.  
- Signal conditioning: surge protection, anti-aliasing filters, ADC/DAC conversion, sampling theorem, aliasing, sliding window, Fourier and FFT.  

### Module 4 – Signal Processing Techniques (6 hours)  
- Sinusoidal wave-based, Fourier-based (half/full cycle), and least squares algorithms.  
- Digital filters: basics of IIR and FIR filters, sine and cosine window filters.  

### Module 5 – Decision Making and Wide-Area Protection (6 hours)  
- Deterministic decision making, statistical hypothesis testing, multiple criteria, adaptive decision schemes.  
- Wide area protection and measurement: PMUs, synchronized sampling, architectures, adaptive relaying, applications of adaptive differential schemes.
