# EET425: Introduction to Power Processing  

## Course Objectives  
- Explain different elements of power electronics.  
- Explain various power electronic converters.  
- Describe the basic principles of AC and DC motor drives.  
- Describe the structure of power processing systems in power supplies, renewable energy conversion, and EVs.  

## Modules  

### Module 1  
- Introduction to power processing, elements of power electronics, power semiconductor devices.  
- Uncontrolled, semicontrolled and fully controlled switches: Diode, SCR, MOSFETs and IGBTs – principle of operation.  
- Advantages of wide bandgap devices – SiC, GaN.  

### Module 2  
- Basic power conversion circuits.  
- Converter circuits: Controlled rectifiers – single-phase fully controlled SCR-based bridge rectifier with R and RL load (continuous mode only).  
- Principle of operation and waveforms (no analysis required).  
- DC-DC Converters (non-isolated): Buck, Boost and Buck-Boost converter – circuit operation, voltage gain and waveforms in continuous conduction mode (no analysis required).  

### Module 3  
- Single-phase half and full bridge inverter: Square-wave operation with R load.  
- Types of PWM – single pulse, multiple pulse and sinusoidal PWM.  
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).  
- Three-phase voltage source inverter with R load – 120° and 180° conduction mode – waveforms.  
- Single-phase AC voltage controller with R load – waveforms.  

### Module 4 – Applications 1: Motor Drives  
- Introduction to electric motor drives – block diagram.  
- 4-quadrant operation of a separately excited DC motor (circuit diagram and waveforms only).  
- Induction motor drives: Principle of operation – v/f control.  

### Module 5 – Applications 2, 3 & 4  
- Renewable energy: Solar PV installations – off-grid and on-grid systems – principle of operation and block diagram.  
- Power supplies: Principle of operation of linear and switched-mode power supplies – requirements – isolation, protection, and regulation.  
- Electric Vehicles: Introduction to HEV, PHEV and BEV – block schematic of power train.  
- Introduction to energy storage in EVs – Li-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells.
