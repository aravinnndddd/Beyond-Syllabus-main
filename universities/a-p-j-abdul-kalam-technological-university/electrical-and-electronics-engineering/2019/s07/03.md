# EET423: Digital Control Systems  

## Course Objectives  
- Describe the various control blocks and components of digital control systems.  
- Analyse sampled data systems in the z-domain.  
- Design a digital controller/compensator in the frequency domain.  
- Design a digital controller/compensator in the time domain.  
- Apply state variable concepts to design controllers for linear discrete-time systems.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Basics of Digital Control  
- Basic digital control system, mathematical modelling.  
- Sampling and reconstruction.  
- Zero-order and first-order hold circuits.  
- Realisation of digital filters.  
- Relation between transfer function and pulse transfer function.  
- Mapping between s-domain and z-domain.  

### Module 2 – Response Computation  
- Pulse transfer function of different configurations of systems.  
- Modified z-transform.  
- Time response of discrete-time systems.  
- Order and type of a system.  
- Steady-state error and static error constants.  

### Module 3 – Design of Controller/Compensator in Frequency Domain  
- Bilinear transformation and sketching of frequency response.  
- Digital P/PI/PID controller design based on frequency response.  
- Digital compensator design based on frequency response.  
- Introduction to design and simulation using MATLAB (for demo/assignment only, not for examination).  

### Module 4 – Design of Controller/Compensator Based on Time Response  
- Design of lag, lead, and lag-lead compensators using root locus.

- Computation of solutions of state equations and state transition matrix.  
- Controllability, observability, and stabilizability of discrete-time systems.  
- Loss of controllability and observability due to sampling.  
- Digital controller and observer design – state feedback, pole placement, full-order observer, reduced-order observer.
