# EET443: Data Structures  

## Course Objectives  
- Analyze the time and space efficiency of data structures.  
- Describe how arrays, records, linked structures, stacks, and queues are used by algorithms.  
- Compare and contrast the benefits of dynamic and static data structure implementations.  
- Explain different memory management techniques and their significance.  
- Develop algorithms incorporating trees and graphs.  

## Modules  

### Module 1 – Basic Concepts of Data Structures  
- Programming methodologies: structured approach, object-oriented approach, stepwise refinement techniques.  
- Algorithms, performance analysis, space complexity, time complexity.  
- Asymptotic notation, complexity calculation of simple algorithms.  

### Module 2 – Arrays, Stacks, and Queues  
- Introduction to data structures: stacks, queues, circular queues, priority queues, double-ended queues.  
- Evaluation of expressions, applications of stacks and queues.  

### Module 3 – Linked Lists  
- Singly linked list and its operations.  
- Doubly linked list, circular linked list.  
- Stacks and queues using linked lists.  
- Polynomial representation using linked lists.  

### Module 4 – Memory Management and Trees  
- Memory management: allocation and deallocation, first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit allocation schemes.  
- Trees and binary trees: tree operations, binary tree representation, tree traversals.  
- Binary search trees and their operations.  

### Module 5 – Graphs  
- Graph definitions and representations.  
- Topological sort, depth-first search (DFS), and breadth-first search (BFS).  
- Shortest-path algorithms, minimum spanning tree (Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms).  
- Applications of graphs.
