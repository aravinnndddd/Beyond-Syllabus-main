# PEEET636 - Digital Signal Processing

## Course Objectives

1.  To provide a thorough understanding of the realisation, design, and analysis of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Discrete Fourier Transform

-   Basic elements of DSP systems. Review of DTFT. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), its properties, and applications. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms including Radix-2 Decimation-in-Time and Decimation-in-Frequency.

### Module 2: Realisation of Digital Filters

-   Introduction to IIR and FIR systems. Realisation structures for IIR systems (Direct, Cascade, Parallel, Lattice) and FIR systems (Direct, Cascade, Lattice). Linear Phase FIR filters.

### Module 3: Design of Digital Filters

-   Design of IIR filters from analog filters (Butterworth) using Impulse Invariance and Bilinear Transformation methods. Design of FIR filters using windowing techniques (Rectangular, Hanning, Hamming).

### Module 4: Finite Word Length Effects and DSP Architecture

-   Effects of finite word length: fixed/floating-point representations, quantization noise, coefficient errors, overflow errors, and limit cycle oscillations. Introduction to the architecture of the TMS320 family of DSP processors.
