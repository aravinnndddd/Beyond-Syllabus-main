## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction and Time Domain Analysis

-   Time domain analysis of first and second-order systems, including impulse and step responses and time-domain specifications. Steady-state error analysis and static error constants.

### Module 2: Root Locus Analysis and Controller Design

-   Root locus technique for stability analysis and understanding the effect of poles and zeros. Design and tuning of P, I, D, and PID controllers using methods like Ziegler-Nichols.

### Module 3: Frequency Domain Analysis

-   Construction and analysis of Bode plots, including gain and phase margins. Correlation between time and frequency domain responses. Stability analysis using Polar plots and the Nyquist stability criterion.

### Module 4: State Space Analysis

-   Introduction to state-space modeling, state variables, and state equations. Relationship between state space and transfer function models, including canonical forms. Solution of time-invariant systems using the state transition matrix. Concepts of Controllability and Observability.
