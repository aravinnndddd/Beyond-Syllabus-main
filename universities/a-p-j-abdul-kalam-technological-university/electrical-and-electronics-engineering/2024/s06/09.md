# PEEET638 - Optimization Techniques

## Course Objectives

1.  To introduce classical optimization, its need, and techniques suitable for application in engineering problems.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Unconstrained Optimization

-   Optimality criteria and methods for single-variable functions (Newton-Raphson, Secant). Optimality criteria and methods for multi-variable functions, including direct search (Hooke-Jeeves) and gradient search (Cauchy's, Newton's).

### Module 2: Linear Programming

-   Formulation of linear programming models and graphical solutions. The Simplex method, Duality, Dual Simplex method, and Karmarkar’s method.

### Module 3: Constrained Optimization - Part 1

-   Handling equality constrained problems using Lagrange multipliers and Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Transformation methods including penalty functions and the Method of Multipliers.

### Module 4: Constrained Optimization - Part 2

-   Constrained direct search methods (Complex method, Random search). Linearization methods such as Successive Linear Programming, Separable Programming, and the Method of Feasible Directions.
