## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Introduction and Mathematical Modelling

-   Open and closed-loop control systems. Transfer function representation of LTI systems. Modelling of electrical and mechanical systems. System representation using block diagrams and signal flow graphs (Mason's gain formula).

### Module 2: Time Domain Performance Analysis
