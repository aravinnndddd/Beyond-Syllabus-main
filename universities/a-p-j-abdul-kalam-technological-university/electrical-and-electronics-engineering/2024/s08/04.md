## Course Objectives

1.  To acquire knowledge about analog and digital communication systems.

---

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Analog Communication

-   Introduction to communication systems and the need for modulation. Amplitude modulation techniques (AM, DSB-SC, SSB), including their spectra, power, and efficiency. AM modulator and demodulator circuits.

### Module 2: Angle Modulation

-   Frequency and phase modulation (FM/PM). Narrow and wideband FM, modulation/demodulation techniques, and pre-emphasis/de-emphasis. Analysis of noise in receivers and performance of analog schemes in AWGN.

### Module 3: Digital Baseband Communication

-   Elements of a digital communication system. The Nyquist Sampling Theorem, Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM). Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) with A-law and µ-law quantization.

### Module 4: Digital Bandpass Communication

-   Digital bandpass modulation techniques including Amplitude, Phase, and Frequency Shift Keying (ASK, PSK, FSK). M-ary schemes such as QPSK, MSK, and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM).
