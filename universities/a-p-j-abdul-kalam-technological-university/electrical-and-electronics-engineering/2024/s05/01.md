## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Power Generation and Load Characteristics

-   Generation from renewable and non-renewable sources (Hydro, thermal, nuclear, solar, wind). Energy storage systems (BESS, CESS). Analysis of load curves, load duration curves, and related factors like load factor, diversity factor, and plant capacity factor.

### Module 2: Transmission Line Parameters and Performance

-   Electrical model of transmission systems. Calculation of line parameters: resistance, inductance, and capacitance. Transmission line modeling as a two-port network and calculation of ABCD parameters. Concepts of Skin Effect, Ferranti Effect, Corona, and insulator string efficiency.

### Module 3: Power Distribution and Modern Transmission

-   Introduction to EHVAC and HVDC systems. Study of underground cables, including classification, capacitance, and grading. Analysis of AC distribution systems (radial, ring main). Methods for power factor improvement and different tariff structures. Introduction to regulated and deregulated energy markets.

### Module 4: Power System Protection

-   Need for protection, primary and back-up schemes. Principles of protective relays (electromechanical, static, microprocessor, numerical) for overcurrent, directional, distance, and differential protection. Operation and classification of circuit breakers (SF6, VCB) and introduction to Gas Insulated Substations (GIS).
