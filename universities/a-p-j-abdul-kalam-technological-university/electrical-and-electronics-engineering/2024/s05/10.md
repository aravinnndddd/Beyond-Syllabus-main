## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Mathematical Foundations for ML

-   Association of variables, probability calculus, summary statistics, probability distributions, and inductive statistics including point estimation, interval estimation, and hypothesis testing (t-test, F-test, ANOVA).

### Module 2: Overview of Machine Learning Algorithms

-   Supervised vs. unsupervised learning. Supervised methods: regression, classification, decision trees, random forests. Unsupervised methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. Introduction to SVMs and re-sampling methods.

### Module 3: Python for Machine Learning

-   Introduction to essential Python libraries for ML: NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and SciKit-Learn. Techniques for data cleaning, pre-processing, and data visualization including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

### Module 4: ML Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation

-   Implementation of algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, k-NN, Decision Trees, SVMs, and Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical) in Python. Evaluation of models using metrics such as MSE, R², accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
