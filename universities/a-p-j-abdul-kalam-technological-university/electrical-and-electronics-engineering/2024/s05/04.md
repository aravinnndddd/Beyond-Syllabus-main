## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: 8085 Microprocessor and Assembly Programming

-   Architecture and features of the 8085 microprocessor, including registers and pin functions. Assembly language programming with the 8085 instruction set, addressing modes, and writing simple programs for arithmetic, logic, and memory operations.

### Module 2: 8085 Operations and Interfacing

-   Stack operations and subroutines using CALL/RETURN. Timing diagrams for machine cycles and instruction cycles. Handling interrupts and interrupt service routines. Interfacing with Analog-to-Digital (ADC) and Digital-to-Analog (DAC) converters.

### Module 3: Introduction to Embedded Systems and Arduino UNO

-   Features and characteristics of embedded systems. Introduction to the Arduino UNO board (ATmega328P), its architecture, and pinout. Programming with the Arduino IDE in Embedded C. Interfacing with LEDs, LCDs, sensors, and actuators.

### Module 4: ARM Architecture and Arduino DUE

-   Comparison of RISC and CISC architectures. Introduction to ARM-based systems via the Arduino DUE board (ARM Cortex-M3). Features, architecture, and pinout of the DUE. Programming basics for the DUE, including timers, ADC/DAC, PWM, and an introduction to the Arduino Cloud Editor.
