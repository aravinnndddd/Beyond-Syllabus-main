# EST120: Basics of Civil & Mechanical Engineering

## Course Objectives

* Provide insight into the disciplines of civil and mechanical engineering and their significance in society.  
* Familiarize students with the components, materials, and construction of buildings.  
* Introduce surveying and basic infrastructure concepts.  
* Explain mechanical engineering principles including thermodynamics, IC engines, refrigeration, pumps, turbines, and manufacturing.  

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (General Introduction to Civil Engineering & Buildings)
* Relevance of Civil Engineering in infrastructure development.
* Responsibilities of a civil engineer.
* Major disciplines: transportation, structural, geotechnical, water resources, and environmental engineering.
* Building types, site selection, components of residential buildings.
* Building regulations: NBC, KBR, CRZ norms (brief).
* Definitions: plinth area, built-up area, carpet area, FAR (as per KBR).

### Module - 2 (Surveying & Construction Materials)
* Importance, objectives, and principles of surveying.
* Conventional materials: bricks, stones, cement, sand, timber.
* Cement concrete: constituents, properties, types.
* Steel: sections, reinforcements, types, and uses.
* Modern materials: glass, ceramics, plastics, composites, insulating/decorative panels, waterproofing.
* Gypsum, prefabricated components (brief).

### Module - 3 (Building Construction & Infrastructure)
* Foundations: functions, bearing capacity, shallow vs deep (brief).
* Load-bearing vs framed structures.
* Brick masonry: header, stretcher, English, Flemish bonds; rubble masonry.
* Roofs and floors: functions, types, flooring materials (brief).
* Basic infrastructure services: MEP, HVAC, elevators, escalators, ramps.
* Fire safety and green buildings: materials, energy, water, environment (brief).

### Module - 4 (Thermodynamic Cycles & IC Engines)
* Carnot, Otto, Diesel cycles – efficiency derivations and problems.
* IC engines: CI, SI, 2-stroke, 4-stroke – parts and systems.
* Definitions of engine efficiencies.
* Fuel, air, cooling, lubricating systems in SI/CI engines.
* CRDI, MPFI, hybrid engines.

### Module - 5 (Refrigeration, Pumps, Turbines & Transmission)
* Refrigeration: unit, reversed Carnot cycle, COP, vapour compression (description only).
* Humidity concepts: dry, wet, dew point temperatures, specific & relative humidity.
* Cooling/dehumidification, layouts of unit/central AC systems.
* Working with sketches: reciprocating & centrifugal pumps, Pelton, Francis & Kaplan turbines.
* Efficiency calculations (no velocity triangles).
* Working with sketches: belt/chain drives, gears, gear trains, single-plate clutches.

### Module - 6 (Manufacturing & Machining)
* Manufacturing processes: sand casting, forging, rolling, extrusion – basic descriptions.
* Metal joining: arc welding, soldering, brazing – sketches & applications.
* Machining operations: turning, drilling, milling, grinding.
* Working (with block diagrams): lathe, drilling, milling, CNC.
* CAD/CAM, rapid & additive manufacturing.
