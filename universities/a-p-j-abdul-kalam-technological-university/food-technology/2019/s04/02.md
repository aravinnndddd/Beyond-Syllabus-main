# MAT204: PROBABILITY, RANDOM PROCESSES AND NUMERICAL METHODS

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: understand the concept, properties and important models of discrete random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena  
- **co 2**: understand the concept, properties and important models of continuous random variables and, using them, analyse suitable random phenomena  
- **co 3**: analyse random processes using autocorrelation, power spectrum and poisson process model as appropriate  
- **co 4**: compute roots of equations, evaluate definite integrals and perform interpolation on given numerical data using standard numerical techniques  
- **co 5**: apply standard numerical techniques for solving systems of equations, fitting curves on given numerical data and solving ordinary differential equations
