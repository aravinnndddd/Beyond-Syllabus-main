# Biomedical Instrumentation

## course objectives
- To understand biomedical instrumentation fundamentals.  
- To analyze physiological parameter measurements.

## course outcomes
- **CO1**: Explain fundamentals of bioelectric potentials and electrode interfaces.  
- **CO2**: Describe cardiovascular monitoring techniques including ECG, phonocardiography and pulse oximetry.  
- **CO3**: Interpret respiratory and neural measurement techniques (spirometry, EEG, EMG) and associated sensors.  
- **CO4**: Summarize imaging and therapeutic instrumentation principles (X-ray/CT/MRI, ultrasound transducers, pacemakers/defibrillators).

## syllabus

### Module 1: Fundamentals (9 hours)
- Origin and characteristics of bioelectric potentials.  
- Signal acquisition chain: electrodes, amplifiers, filters, isolation.  
- Electrode types and interfaces: surface, needle, invasive electrodes; skin-electrode impedance; electrode polarization.  
- Basic signal conditioning and safety (isolation, grounding, common-mode rejection).

### Module 2: Cardiovascular Instrumentation (9 hours)
- ECG: lead systems (standard 3/5/12 lead), lead placement, typical waveforms, artifacts and filtering.  
- Phonocardiography: sensors, signal features, analysis.  
- Pulse oximetry: principle of operation, plethysmogram, limitations and calibration.  
- Noninvasive blood pressure measurement basics.

### Module 3: Respiratory and Neural Measurements (9 hours)
- Spirometry: lung volumes and capacities, flow sensors, interpretation of spirograms.  
- EEG: electrode placement (10–20 system), waveform types, basic acquisition and artifact handling.  
- EMG: signal characteristics, surface vs intramuscular electrodes, applications in prosthetics and rehabilitation.  
- Basic neural signal processing concepts.

### Module 4: Imaging & Therapeutic Instrumentation (9 hours)
- Overview of imaging modalities: X-ray, CT and MRI principles (basic instrumentation and safety considerations).  
- Diagnostic ultrasound: transducer types and basic beam formation.  
- Therapeutic devices: pacemakers (modes, components), external/implantable defibrillators — principles and safety.  
- Introduction to device standards and regulatory/safety issues (brief overview).
