# CST201: DATA STRUCTURES

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: design an algorithm for a computational task and calculate the time/space complexities of that algorithm  
- **co 2**: identify suitable data structures such as arrays or linked lists to solve a given computational problem and write appropriate algorithms  
- **co 3**: write algorithms using data structures like binary trees or graphs for solving computational problems  
- **co 4**: store a given dataset using appropriate hash functions for efficient access  
- **co 5**: select and apply appropriate sorting algorithms based on the context  
- **co 6**: design and implement data structures to solve real-world problems efficiently
