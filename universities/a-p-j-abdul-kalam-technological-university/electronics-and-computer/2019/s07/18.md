# ERT426: SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: understand basic concepts of speech production, speech analysis, speech coding and parametric representation of speech and apply it in practical applications  
- **co 2**: develop systems for various applications of speech processing  
- **co 3**: learn signal processing models of sound perception and application of perception models in audio signal processing  
- **co 4**: implement audio compression algorithms and standards  
- **co 5**: perform audio quality analysis
