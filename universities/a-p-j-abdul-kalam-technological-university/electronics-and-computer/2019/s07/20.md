# ERT446: PYTHON BASICS FOR MACHINE LEARNING

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: write, test and debug python programs  
- **co 2**: illustrate uses of conditional (if, if-else, if-elif-else and switch-case) and iterative (while and for) statements in python programs  
- **co 3**: develop programs by utilizing the modules lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries in python  
- **co 4**: implement object oriented programs with exception handling  
- **co 5**: write programs in python to process data stored in files by utilizing the modules numpy and pandas  

## syllabus

### module 1: programming environment and python basics

- getting started with python programming: running code in the interactive shell, editing, saving, and running a script  
- using editors: idle, jupyter  
- basic coding skills: working with data types, numeric data types and character sets, keywords, variables and assignment statement  
- operators, expressions, working with numeric data, type conversions, comments in the program  
- input, processing, and output  
- formatting output  

### module 2: building python programs

- control statements: selection structure (if-else, switch-case), iteration structure (for, while), testing the control statements, lazy evaluation  
- functions: hiding redundancy and complexity, arguments and return values, variable scopes and parameter passing, named arguments, main function, recursion, lambda functions  
- strings and number systems: string function, handling numbers in various formats  

### module 3: data representation

- lists: basic operations and functions, list of lists, slicing, searching and sorting lists, list comprehension  
- tuples and sets  
- working with dates and times  
- dictionaries: dictionary functions, dictionary literals, adding/removing keys, accessing/replacing values, traversing dictionaries, reverse lookup  

### module 4: object oriented programming

- design with classes: objects and classes, methods, instance variables, constructor, accessors and mutators  
- structuring classes with inheritance and polymorphism, abstract classes  
- exceptions: handle a single exception, handle multiple exceptions  

### module 5: data processing

- the os and sys modules  
- introduction to file i/o: reading and writing text files, manipulating binary files  
- numpy: basics, creating arrays, arithmetic, slicing, matrix operations, random numbers, plotting and visualization  
- working with csv files  
- pandas: reading, manipulating, and processing data
