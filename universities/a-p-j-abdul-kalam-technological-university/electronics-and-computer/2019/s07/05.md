# ERT443: FORMAL LANGUAGES AND AUTOMATA THEORY

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: understand the fundamental concepts of formal language theory, deterministic and nondeterministic finite state automata, equivalence between dfa and nfa, regular grammars, and their equivalence with dfa  
- **co 2**: understand the concepts of regular expressions, equivalence between res and dfa, pumping lemma for regular languages, closure properties of regular languages, and dfa state minimization  
- **co 3**: implement context-free grammars (cfg) for representing context-free languages with correctness proofs, derivation trees, ambiguity resolution, and transformation into chomsky normal form and greibach normal form  
- **co 4**: design a pushdown automaton and a context-free grammar for a given context-free language  
- **co 5**: design turing machines as language acceptors or transducers
