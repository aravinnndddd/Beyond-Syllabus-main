# ERT413: NETWORK AND LINEAR CONTROL SYSTEMS

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: understanding and application of the fundamentals of electrical circuits, their elements and network reduction techniques.
- **co 2**: analysis and modelling of mechanical systems using translational and rotational systems, along with the understanding of force voltage & force-current analogy.
- **co 3**: implementing techniques to ensure the stability of linear control systems; using the routh’s hurwitz criterion, root locus method and frequency response analysis.
- **co 4**: understand and model control systems using laplace transforms and transfer functions to analyze electrical networks and control systems structures.
- **co 5**: apply poles and zeros concept, analyze first and second order systems, and compute static and dynamic error coefficients within time domain analysis of feedback control systems.
