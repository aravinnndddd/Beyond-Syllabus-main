# ERT305: DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: summarize and exemplify fundamental nature and characteristics of database systems  
- **co 2**: model real word scenarios given as informal descriptions, using entity relationship diagrams  
- **co 3**: model and design solutions for efficiently representing and querying data using relational model  
- **co 4**: demonstrate the features of indexing and hashing in database applications  
- **co 5**: discuss and compare the aspects of concurrency control and recovery in database systems  
- **co 6**: explain various types of nosql databases  

## syllabus

### module 1: introduction & entity relationship (er) model

- concept & overview of dbms  
- characteristics of database system  
- database users  
- structured, semi-structured and unstructured data  
- data models and schema – three schema architecture  
- database languages, architectures and classification  
- er model – basic concepts, entity set & attributes, notations, relationships and constraints  
- cardinality, participation, weak entities, relationships of degree 3  

### module 2: relational model

- structure of relational databases, integrity constraints  
- synthesizing er diagram to relational schema  
- relational algebra – select, project, cartesian product, join (equi-join, natural join)  
- introduction to sql – ddl: create, drop, alter; dml: insert, delete, update  

### module 3: sql dml & physical data organization

- sql queries – single and multiple tables  
- nested queries (correlated and non-correlated), aggregation, grouping  
- views, assertions, triggers  
- physical data organization – heap files, pinned/unpinned, blocking factor  
- indexing – single-level, multi-level indices, b-trees, b+-trees (structure only)  
- extendible hashing, grid files, indexing on multiple keys  

### module 4: normalization

- database anomalies, idea of normalization  
- functional dependency, armstrong’s axioms, closures, fd equivalence  
- minimal cover, 1nf, 2nf, 3nf, bcnf  
- lossless join and dependency preserving decomposition  
- algorithms for checking lossless join and dependency preservation  

### module 5: transactions, concurrency and recovery, recent topics

- transaction processing concepts – concurrency control, transaction model  
- transaction states, system log, serial/concurrent schedules  
- conflict equivalence & serializability, recoverable and cascade-less schedules  
- two-phase locking and variations, log-based recovery  
- deferred modification, check-pointing  
- introduction to nosql databases:  
  - key-value db (e.g. redis)  
  - document db (e.g. mongodb)  
  - column-family db (e.g. cassandra)  
  - graph db (e.g. arangodb)
