# ERT307: MICROPROCESSORS AND ADVANCED MICROCONTROLLERS

## course outcomes

- **co 1**: illustrate the architecture, modes of operation and addressing modes of microprocessors  
- **co 2**: develop 8086 assembly language programs  
- **co 3**: demonstrate interrupts, its handling and programming in 8086  
- **co 4**: outline features of microcontrollers and develop low level programs  
- **co 5**: describe the building blocks of risc processors and arm microcontrollers
