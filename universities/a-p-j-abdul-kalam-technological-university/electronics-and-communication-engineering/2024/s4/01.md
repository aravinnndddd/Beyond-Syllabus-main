### Module 3: Statistical Inference
- Confidence intervals, confidence level, one-sided confidence intervals for a population mean (large and small samples – normal & t-distribution).  
- Hypotheses and test procedures, Type I & Type II errors.  
- z-tests for population mean (large sample), t-tests for population mean (small sample).  
- Tests concerning a population proportion for large and small samples.
