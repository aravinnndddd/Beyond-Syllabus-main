# PEECT415 - Digital Systems and VLSI Design

## Course Objectives

1. To equip students with comprehensive knowledge and skills in designing, analysing, modelling, and optimizing clocked synchronous sequential networks (CSSNs).  
2. To provide a thorough understanding of the designing, analyzing, and optimizing techniques of asynchronous sequential circuits (ASCs).  
3. To equip students with the knowledge and skills to identify and mitigate static and dynamic hazards and to understand fault detection and testing methods.  
4. To provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the VLSI design flow and the application of VHDL constructs and coding for combinational and sequential circuits.
