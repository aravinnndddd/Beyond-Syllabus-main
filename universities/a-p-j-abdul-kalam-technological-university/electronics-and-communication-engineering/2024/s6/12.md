## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
**Introduction to Computer Networks**  
- Components of computer networks.  
- Transmission modes: serial and parallel, asynchronous, synchronous, simplex, half duplex, full duplex communication.  
- Switching: circuit switching and packet switching.  
- Networks: network criteria, physical structures, network models, categories of networks, interconnection of networks.  
- Delay and loss in packet-switched networks, types of delay, packet loss.  
- Layered architecture: OSI model.  

---

### Module 2
**TCP/IP Protocol Suite & Application/Transport Layers**  
- TCP/IP protocol suite overview.  
- Application layer: communication between processes, HTTP (web application), email (SMTP, MIME, POP3), DNS.  
- Transport layer: connectionless and connection-oriented protocols.  
- UDP.  
- Reliable data transfer: ARQ protocols (stop-and-wait, alternating-bit, Go-Back-N, selective repeat).  
- TCP: connection setup, segment structure, RTT estimation, flow control.  
- Congestion control: general approaches, TCP congestion control.

### Module 3
**Network Layer Protocols & Routing**  
- Datagram vs virtual-circuit network service.  
- Router architecture, routing and forwarding, static and dynamic routing.  
- Address resolution protocols: ARP, RARP.  
- Subnetting, CIDR, ICMP.  
- IPv4: datagram format, fragmentation/reassembly, addressing, address assignment (manual, DHCP).  
- IPv6: datagram format, transitioning from IPv4, IP security.  
- Routing algorithms: link-state (Dijkstra), distance vector.  
- Internet routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, BGP.  

---

### Module 4
**Link Layer, MAC, and Physical Layer**  
- Link layer services, error detection and correction: checksum, CRC.  
- Multiple access protocols: channel partitioning, random access (ALOHA – pure/slotted, CSMA, CSMA/CA, CSMA/CD).  
- Link layer addressing: MAC address, Ethernet.  
- Wireless networks: IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN.  
- Physical layer: guided media (co-axial cable, UTP, STP, fiber optic cable) and unguided transmission media.
