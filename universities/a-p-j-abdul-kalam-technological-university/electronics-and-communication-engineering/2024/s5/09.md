# PEECT526 - High Speed Digital Design

## Course Objectives

1. Understand the fundamentals of the effects of passive circuit elements on signal propagation in high-speed digital circuits.  
2. Understand the high-speed properties of logic gates and the measurement techniques at high frequencies.  
3. Analyse the effects of wiring, source, and load on the signal propagation from one end of a circuit to the other.  
4. Design the power supply and clock distribution circuits for high-speed devices.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
- High-Speed Digital Design Fundamentals: Frequency and time, time and distance, lumped versus distributed systems.  
- Four kinds of reactance: ordinary capacitance and inductance, mutual capacitance and inductance.  
- Relation of mutual capacitance and mutual inductance to cross talk.

---

### Module 2
- High-speed properties of logic gates: Power, quiescent vs active dissipation, active power driving a capacitive load, active power due to overlapping bias currents, input power, speed, packaging. *(Power dissipation analysis of only CMOS logic gates is required)*  
- Measurement Techniques: Rise time and bandwidth of oscilloscope probes, self-inductance of probe ground loop, spurious signal pick-up from probe ground loops, special probing fixtures, avoiding pickup from probe shield currents, slowing down a system clock, observing metastable states.

---

### Module 3
- Transmission Lines: Problems of point-to-point wiring, signal distortion, EMI, cross talk.  
- Infinite uniform transmission line, ideal distortionless lossless transmission line, RC transmission line, skin effect, proximity effect, dielectric loss.  
- Effects of source and load impedance.  
- Termination: End terminator, source terminator, middle terminator, AC biasing for end terminators, resistor selection, cross talk in terminators.

---

### Module 4
- Power System: Stable voltage reference, uniform voltage distribution, distribution problems, choosing a bypass capacitor.  
- Clock Distribution: Timing margin, clock skew, using low impedance drivers, low impedance distribution lines, delay adjustments, differential distribution, clock signal duty cycle, decoupling clock receivers from the clock bus.  
- Clock Oscillators: Canned clock oscillator, clock jitter.
