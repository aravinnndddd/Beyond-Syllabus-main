## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1
- Introduction: Basic components of control systems, open-loop and closed-loop control systems with examples.  
- Mathematical modelling of control systems: Electrical systems and mechanical translational systems.  
- Transfer function: Block diagram reduction techniques, signal flow graph, Mason’s gain formula.  

---

### Module 2
- Time domain analysis of control systems: Standard test signals.  
- Time response of first order systems (unit impulse, step and ramp inputs) and second order systems (step input only).  
- Time response of undamped, underdamped, critically damped second order system to unit step signal.  
- Time domain specifications for a second order underdamped system.  
- Steady state error and static error coefficients.

### Module 3
- Stability of linear control systems: Concept of BIBO stability, absolute stability, Routh-Hurwitz criterion.  
- Root locus techniques: Introduction, properties and construction.  
- Frequency domain analysis: Frequency domain specifications, relative stability (gain margin and phase margin).  
- Stability analysis using Bode plot and Nyquist stability criterion.  
- P, PI & PID controllers: Introduction.  
- Design of compensators: Need for compensators, lag and lead compensators using Bode plots (only design steps).

### Module 4
- State variable analysis of linear systems: State variables, state equations, state variable representation of electrical systems.  
- Transfer function from state equation.  
- Solutions of the state equations, state transition matrix.  
- Controllability and observability – Kalman’s test.
