# MAT204: Probability, Random Processes and Numerical Methods

## Course Objectives

- To introduce the fundamental concepts and models of probability and statistics used in engineering applications.  
- To develop an understanding of discrete and continuous random variables, and their practical significance.  
- To expose students to the analysis of random processes and their properties.  
- To provide students with foundational tools in numerical methods for solving algebraic equations, integration, and interpolation.  
- To enable students to apply numerical techniques in solving systems of equations and differential equations relevant to engineering.
