# ECT307: Control Systems

## Course Objectives

- To understand the basic concepts of control systems including mathematical modeling of physical systems.  
- To analyze the time response and frequency response of linear time-invariant systems.  
- To evaluate the stability of control systems using different techniques.  
- To design controllers and compensators for improving system performance.  
- To analyze systems using state space representation and assess controllability and observability.

## Course Outcomes

- Analyze electromechanical systems by mathematical modelling and derive their transfer functions.  
- Determine transient and steady-state behaviour of systems using standard test signals.  
- Determine absolute stability and relative stability of a system.  
- Apply frequency domain techniques to assess the system performance and to design a control system with suitable compensation techniques.  
- Analyze system controllability and observability using state space representation.
