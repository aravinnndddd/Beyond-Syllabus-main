- To expose students to high performance computing techniques to accelerate data analysis.

## Course Outcomes

- Read and write data to and from spreadsheets and databases.
- Work with large datasets as Pandas data frames.
- Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis on data frames.
- Perform Bayesian analysis on data frames.
- Apply machine learning algorithms to data analysis problems.
- Utilize high performance computing tools for efficient data processing.
