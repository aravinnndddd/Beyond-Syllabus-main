# ECT473: DSP Architectures

## Course Objectives

- Understand the basic resource constraints in DSP systems and techniques to overcome them.
- Study single-core and multicore DSP architectures for real-world applications.
- Develop DSP algorithms on modern hardware and software platforms.

## Course Outcomes

- Identify the basic resource constraints in a practical DSP system and solve them using various techniques/transformations that map the DSP algorithms to efficient architectures.
- Illustrate various single-core and multicore Digital Signal Processor architectures and identify the optimal processor for solving real-life signal processing problems.
- Develop algorithms to solve signal processing problems using the latest hardware platforms and software tools.
