# 24-360-0302: BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION

## Course Objectives
* To understand the fundamental concepts and types of biodiversity and to evaluate the economic
and philosophical values of biodiversity. To analyze the role and effectiveness of conservation
strategies and techniques and to identify and assess the major threats to biodiversity at local
and global scales. To examine the biodiversity of India and its conservation policies and laws.

## Course Outcomes

* **CO 2:** Capacity to critically evaluate the economic and philosophical dimensions of biodiversity.
* **CO 3:** Proficiency in designing and implementing conservation strategies.
* **CO 4:** Competence in analyzing and addressing threats to biodiversity.
* **CO 5:** Understanding of India’s biodiversity richness and conservation efforts,
with insights into future directions.
