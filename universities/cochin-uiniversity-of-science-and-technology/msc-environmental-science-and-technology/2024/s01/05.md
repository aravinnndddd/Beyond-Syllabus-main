# 24-360-0105: ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY

## Course Objectives
* Course aims to introduce basic biology students to the world of microbes. Students will familiarize with different types of microbes present in the environment, to isolate those microbes, identify and characterize them. Course will cover the structure, reproduction, clinical manifestations, epidemiology and preventive measures of different pathogens present in the environment.


## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Explain the basics of microbiological techniques, isolation techniques and microscopy.
* **CO 2:** Discuss the concept and goal of molecular microbiology, gene structure and regulation in bacteria.
* **CO 3:** Describe the structure, function, nutrition and its uptake in bacteria, fungi, protozoa and algae.
* **CO 4:** Discuss the structure, properties and cultivation of pathogenic viruses.
* **CO 5:** Describe the microbial interactions, nutrient cycling, factors affecting their growth and microbial ecology.
