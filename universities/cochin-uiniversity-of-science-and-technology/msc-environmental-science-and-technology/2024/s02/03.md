# 24-360-0203: GEO-INFORMATICS

## Course Objectives
* This course offers a thorough introduction to the fundamental principles and practical applications of Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Cartography and Surveying Techniques. Starting with the basics of remote sensing, it progresses to detailed image processing techniques for data analysis and interpretation. This includes an exploration of essentials of GIS, from components and data management to spatial analysis and applications, before concluding with foundational cartography concepts and modern surveying methods. Designed to equip students with both theoretical understanding and practical skills, this course prepares participants for effective application in environmental management, geographical analysis, and beyond, bridging technology and real-world challenges.

## Course Outcomes
* **CO 1:** Gain knowledge of the principles and concepts of Remote Sensing and its applications.
* **CO 2:** Acquire knowledge on analysing and interpreting remote sensing data through visual interpretation and image processing techniques.
* **CO 3:** Understand GIS fundamentals, data management, and spatial analysis.
* **CO 4:** Explore cartography, focusing on map making and GPS technology.
